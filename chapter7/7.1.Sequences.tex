\subsection*{Introduction}

We encounter sequences every day. Your monthly rent payments, the annual interest you earn on investments, a list of your car's miles per gallon every time you fill up; all are examples of sequences. Other sequences with which you may be familiar include the Fibonacci sequence\index{Fibonacci sequence}
\[1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, \ldots\]
in which each entry is the sum of the two preceding entries and the triangular numbers\index{triangular numbers}
\[1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, \ldots\]
which are numbers that correspond to the number of vertices seen in the triangles in Figure \ref{F:8.1.Triangular_numbers}.

Sequences of integers are of such interest to mathematicians and others that they have a journal\footnote{\emph{The Journal of Integer Sequences} at \url{http://www.cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/}} devoted to them and an on-line encyclopedia\footnote{The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences at \url{http://oeis.org/}} that catalogs a huge number of integer sequences and their connections. Sequences are also used in digital recordings and digital images. 

To this point, most of our studies in calculus have dealt with continuous information (e.g., continuous functions). The major difference we will see now is that sequences model \emph{discrete} instead of continuous information. We will study ways to represent and work with discrete information in this chapter as we investigate \emph{sequences} and \emph{series}, and ultimately see key connections between the discrete and continuous.

\subsection*{Sequences} \index{sequence}

As our discussion in the introduction and Preview Activity \ref{PA:8.1} illustrate, many discrete phenomena can be represented as lists of numbers (like the amount of money in an account over a period of months). We commonly refer to a set of events that occur one after the other as a \textit{sequence} of events. In mathematics, we use the word \textit{sequence} to refer to an ordered set of numbers, i.e., a set of numbers that ``occur one after the other.''

For instance, the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, \ldots, form a sequence. The order is important; the first number is 2, the second is 4, etc. It seems natural to seek a formula that describes a given sequence, and often this can be done. For instance, the sequence above could be described by the function $a(n) = 2n$, for the values of $n = 1, 2, \ldots$ To find the 10$^\text{th}$ term in the sequence, we would compute $a(10)$. This leads us to the following, formal definition of a sequence.

\definition{Sequence}{
A \textbf{sequence} is a function $a(n)$ whose domain is $\mathbb{N}$. The \textbf{range} of a sequence is the set of all distinct values of $a(n)$.
\index{sequences!definition}\\

The \textbf{terms} of a sequence are the values $a(1)$, $a(2)$, \ldots, which are usually denoted with subscripts as $a_1$, $a_2$, \ldots.\\

A sequence $a(n)$ is often denoted as $\{a_n\}$.
}% end definition

If the terms are all 0 after some fixed value of $n$, we say the sequence is finite. Otherwise the sequence is infinite. We will work with both finite and infinite sequences, but focus more on the infinite sequences. With infinite sequences, we are often interested in their end behavior and the idea of \emph{convergent} sequences.

Next we formalize the ideas from Activity~\ref{7.1.Act1}.

A common mathematical endeavor is to create a new mathematical object (for instance, a sequence) and then apply previously known mathematics to the new object. We do so here. The fundamental concept of calculus is the limit, so we will investigate what it means to find the limit of a sequence.

\definition{Limit of a Sequence, Convergent, Divergent} %DEFINITION
{Let $\{a_n\}$ be a sequence and let $L$ be a real number. Given any $\epsilon>0$, if an $m$ can be found such that $|a_n-L|<\epsilon$ for all $n>m$, then we say the \textbf{limit of $\{a_n\}$, as $n$ approaches infinity, is $L$}, denoted $$\lim_{n\to\infty}a_n = L.$$

If $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n$ exists, we say the sequence \emph{converges}; otherwise, the sequence \emph{diverges}.\index{limit!of sequence}\index{sequences!limit}\index{convergence!of sequence}\index{divergence!of sequence}\index{sequences!convergent}\index{sequences!divergent}
} %end DEFINITION

This definition states, informally, that if the limit of a sequence is $L$, then if you go far enough out along the sequence, all subsequent terms will be \emph{really close} to $L$. Of course, the terms ``far enough'' and ``really close'' are subjective terms, but hopefully the intent is clear.

This definition is reminiscent of the $\epsilon$--$\delta$ proofs of Chapter~\ref{CH:1}. In that chapter we developed other tools to evaluate limits apart from the formal definition; we do so here as well.

\concept{Limit of a Sequence}  %concept
{Let $\{a_n\}$ be a sequence and let $f(x)$ be a function where $f(n) = a_n$ for all $n$ in $\mathbb{N}$. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item		If $\ds \lim_{x\to\infty} f(x) = L$, then $\ds\lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = L$.
\item		If $\ds \lim_{x\to\infty} f(x)$ does not exist, then $\{a_n\}$ diverges.
\end{enumerate}
} %end concept

When we considered limits before, the domain of the function was an interval of real numbers. Now, as we consider limits, the domain is restricted to $\mathbb{N}$, the natural numbers; this restriction of the domain does not affect the outcome of the limit and whatever tools we developed in Chapter~\ref{CH:1} to evaluate limits can be applied here as well.

It seems very clear that a sequence such as $\ds \left\{\frac{(-1)^n}{n}\right\}$ converges to 0 but we lack the formal tool to prove it. The following theorem gives us that tool.

\concept{Absolute Value Theorem} %concept
{Let $\{a_n\}$ be a sequence. If $\ds \lim_{n\to\infty} |a_n| = 0$, then $\ds \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = 0$\index{Absolute Value Theorem}\index{limit!Absolute Value Theorem}\index{sequence!Absolute Value Theorem}

\subsection*{Properties of Sequences} %\index{sequence}

We continue our study of the limits of sequences by considering some of the properties of these limits.

\concept{Properties of the Limits of Sequences} %concept
{Let $\{a_n\}$ and $\{b_n\}$ be sequences such that $\ds \lim_{n\to\infty} a_n = L$, $\ds \lim_{n\to\infty} b_n = K$, and let $c$ be a real number.

\begin{minipage}[t]{.5\linewidth}
\begin{enumerate}
\item		$\ds \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n\pm b_n) = L\pm K$
\index{sequences!limit properties}
\item		$\ds \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n\cdot b_n) = L\cdot K$
\end{enumerate}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}[t]{.5\linewidth}
\begin{enumerate}\addtocounter{enumi}{2}
\item		$\ds \lim_{n\to\infty} (a_n/b_n) = L/K$, $K\neq 0$
\item		$\ds \lim_{n\to\infty} c\cdot a_n = c\cdot L$
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{More with Sequences}
There is more to learn about sequences than just their limits. We will also study their range and the relationships terms have with the terms that follow. We start with some definitions describing properties of the range.

\definition{Bounded and Unbounded Sequences} %DEFINITION
{A sequence $\{a_n\}$ is said to be \textbf{bounded} if there exists real numbers $m$ and $M$ such that $m < a_n < M$ for all $n$ in $\mathbb{N}$.\\

A sequence $\{a_n\}$ is said to be \textbf{unbounded} if it is not bounded.\\

A sequence $\{a_n\}$ is said to be \textbf{bounded above} if there exists an $M$ such that $a_n < M$ for all $n$ in $\mathbb{N}$; it is \textbf{bounded below} if there exists an $m$ such that $m<a_n$ for all $n$ in $\mathbb{N}$.
\index{sequences!boundedness}\index{bounded sequence}\index{unbounded sequence}
} %end DEFINITION


It follows from this definition that an unbounded sequence may be bounded above or bounded below; a sequence that is both bounded above and below is simply a bounded sequence.\\

\input{examples/7-1_Eg6.tex}

The previous example produces some interesting concepts. First, we can recognize that the sequence $\ds\left\{1/n\right\}$ converges to 0. This says, informally, that ``most'' of the terms of the sequence are ``really close'' to 0. This implies that the sequence is bounded, using the following logic. First, ``most'' terms are near 0, so we could find some sort of bound on these terms, which is $\epsilon$. That leaves a ``few'' terms that are not near $0$ (i.e., a \emph{finite} number of terms). A finite list of numbers is always bounded. 

This logic implies that if a sequence converges, it must be bounded. This is indeed true, as stated by the following concept.

\concept{Convergent Sequences are Bounded} %concept
{Let $\ds \left\{a_n\right\}$ be a convergent sequence. Then $\{a_n\}$ is bounded.
\index{bounded sequence!convergence}\index{convergence!of sequence}\index{sequences!convergent}
} % end concept

\textbf{Note:} Keep in mind what the concept does \emph{not} say. It does not say that bounded sequences must converge, nor does it say that if a sequence does not converge, it is not bounded.

In Example~\ref{eg:7.1.4} we saw the sequence $\ds \{b_n\} = \left\{\left(1+1/n\right)^{n}\right\}$, where it was stated that $\ds \lim_{n\to\infty} b_n = e$.  Even though it may be difficult to intuitively grasp the behavior of this sequence, we know immediately that it is bounded.

Another interesting concept to come out of Example~\ref{eg:7.1.5} again involves the sequence $\{1/n\}$. We stated, without proof, that the terms of the sequence were decreasing. That is, that $a_{n+1} < a_n$ for all $n$. (This is easy to show. Clearly $n < n+1$. Taking reciprocals flips the inequality: $1/n > 1/(n+1)$. This is the same as $a_n > a_{n+1}$.) Sequences that either steadily increase or decrease are important, so we give this property a name.

\definition{Monotonic Sequences} %definition
{\begin{enumerate}
\item		A sequence $\{a_n\}$ is \textbf{monotonically increasing} if $a_n \leq a_{n+1}$ for all $n$, i.e.,
 $$a_1 \leq a_2 \leq a_3 \leq \cdots a_n \leq a_{n+1} \cdots$$
 \item	A sequence $\{a_n\}$ is \textbf{monotonically decreasing} if $a_n \geq a_{n+1}$ for all $n$, i.e.,
 $$a_1 \geq a_2 \geq a_3 \geq \cdots a_n \geq a_{n+1} \cdots$$
 \item	A sequence is \textbf{monotonic} if it is monotonically increasing or monotonically decreasing.
\index{sequences!monotonic}\index{monotonic sequence}
 \end{enumerate}
} %end definition

{\textbf{Note:} It is sometimes useful to call a monotonically increasing sequence \emph{strictly increasing} if $a_n < a_{n+1}$ for all $n$; i.e, we remove the possibility that subsequent terms are equal.  A similar statement holds for \emph{strictly decreasing.}


%\input{examples/7-1_Eg7.tex} %example monotonicity

Knowing that a sequence is monotonic can be useful. In particular, if we know that a sequence is bounded and monotonic, we can conclude it converges! Consider, for example, a sequence that is monotonically decreasing and is bounded below. We know the sequence is always getting smaller, but that there is a bound to how small it can become. This is enough to prove that the sequence will converge, as stated in the following theorem.

\concept{Bounded Monotonic Sequences are Convergent}%concept 
{\begin{enumerate}
\item		Let $\{a_n\}$ be a bounded, monotonic sequence. Then $\{a_n\}$ converges; i.e., $\ds \lim_{n \to\infty}a_n$ exists.
\item		Let $\{a_n\}$ be a monotonically increasing sequence that is bounded above. Then $\{a_n\}$ converges.
\item		Let $\{a_n\}$ be a monotonically decreasing sequence that is bounded below. Then $\{a_n\}$ converges.
\index{sequences!convergent}\index{convergence!of monotonic sequences}
\end{enumerate}
} %end concept

Consider once again the sequence $\{a_n\} = \{1/n\}$. It is easy to show it is monotonically decreasing and that it is always positive (i.e., bounded below by $0$). Therefore we can conclude that the sequence converges. We already knew this by other means, but in the following section this theorem will become very useful.

Sequences are a great source of mathematical inquiry. The On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (\url{http://oeis.org}) contains thousands of sequences and their formulae. (As of this writing, there are $218,626$ sequences in the database.) Perusing this database quickly demonstrates that a single sequence can represent several different ``real life'' phenomena. 

Interesting as this is, our interest actually lies elsewhere. We are more interested in the \emph{sum} of a sequence. That is, given a sequence $\{a_n\}$, we are very interested in $a_1+a_2+a_3+\cdots$. Of course, one might immediately counter with ``Doesn't this just add up to infinity?'' Many times, yes, but there are many important cases where the answer is no. This is the topic of \emph{series}, which we begin to investigate in the next section.

\begin{summary}
\item A sequence is a list of objects in a specified order. We will typically work with sequences of real numbers and can also think of a sequence as a function from the positive integers to the set of real numbers.
\item A sequence $\{s_n\}$ of real numbers converges to a number $L$ if we can make every value of  $s_k$ for $k \ge n$ as close as we want to $L$ by choosing $n$ sufficiently large.
\item A sequence diverges if it does not converge.
