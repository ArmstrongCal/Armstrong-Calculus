\subsection*{Introduction}

We have seen that we can use the first derivative of a function to determine where the function is increasing or decreasing, and the second derivative to know where the function is concave up or concave down.  Each of these approaches provides us with key information that helps us determine the overall shape and behavior of the graph, as well as whether the function has a relative minimum or relative maximum at a given critical value.  Remember that the difference between a relative maximum and a global maximum is that there is a relative maximum of $f$ at $x = p$ if $f(p) \ge f(x)$ for all $x$ near $p$, while there is a global maximum at $p$ if $f(p) \ge f(x)$ for all $x$ in the domain of $f$.

\end{marginfigure}

For instance, in Figure~\ref{F:3.3.Intro}, we see a function $f$ that has a global maximum at $x = c$ and a relative maximum at $x = a$, since $f(c)$ is greater than $f(x)$ for every value of $x$, while $f(a)$ is only greater than the value of $f(x)$ for $x$ near $a$.  Since the function appears to decrease without bound, $f$ has no global minimum, though clearly $f$ has a relative minimum at $x = b$.

Our emphasis in this section is on finding the global extreme values of a function (if they exist).  In so doing, we will either be interested in the behavior of the function over its entire domain or on some restricted portion.  The former situation is familiar and similar to work that we did in the two preceding sections of the text.  We explore this through a particular example in the following preview activity.

\subsection*{Global Optimization}

For the functions in Figure~\ref{F:3.3.Intro} and Preview Activity~\ref{PA:3.3}, we were interested in finding the global minimum and global maximum on the entire domain, which turned out to be $(-\infty, \infty)$ for each.  At other times, our perspective on a function might be more focused due to some restriction on its domain.  For example, rather than considering $f(x) = 2 + \frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}$ for every value of $x$,  perhaps instead we are only interested in those $x$ for which $0 \le x \le 4$, and we would like to know which values of $x$ in the interval $[0,4]$ produce the largest possible and smallest possible values of $f$.  We are accustomed to critical values playing a key role in determining the location of extreme values of a function; now, by restricting the domain to an interval, it makes sense that the endpoints of the interval will also be important to consider, as we see in the following activity.  When limiting ourselves to a particular interval, we will often refer to the \emph{absolute} maximum or minimum value, rather than the \emph{global} maximum or minimum.

\input{activities/3.3.Act1} %ACTIVITY

In Activity~\ref{A:3.3.1}, we saw how the absolute maximum and absolute minimum of a function on a closed, bounded interval $[a,b]$, depend not only on the critical values of the function, but also on the selected values of $a$ and $b$.  These observations demonstrate several important facts that hold much more generally.  First, we state an important result called the Extreme Value Theorem.

\concept{The Extreme Value Theorem\index{extreme value theorem}} % CONCEPT
{If $f$ is a continuous function on a closed interval $[a,b]$, then $f$ attains both an absolute minimum and absolute maximum on $[a,b]$.  That is, for some value $x_m$ such that $a \le x_m \le b$, it follows that $f(x_m) \le f(x)$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$.  Similarly, there is a value $x_M$ in $[a,b]$ such that $f(x_M) \geq f(x)$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$.  Letting $m = f(x_m)$ and $M = f(x_M)$, it follows that $m \le f(x) \le M$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$.
} % end concept

The Extreme Value Theorem tells us that provided a function is continuous on any closed interval, $[a,b]$, the function has to achieve both an absolute minimum and an absolute maximum.  Note, however, that this result does not tell us where these extreme values occur, but rather only that they must exist.  As seen in the examples of Activity~\ref{A:3.3.1}, it is apparent that the only possible locations for absolute extremes are either the endpoints of the interval or at a critical value (the latter being where a relative miniumum or maximum could occur, which is a potential location for an absolute extreme).  Thus, we have the following approach to finding the absolute maximum and minimum of a continuous function $f$ on the interval $[a,b]$:
\begin{itemize}
	\item find all critical values of $f$ that lie in the interval;
	\item evaluate the function $f$ at each critical value in the interval and at each endpoint of the interval;
	\item from among the noted function values, the smallest is the absolute minimum of $f$ on the interval, while the largest is the absolute maximum.
\end{itemize}

One of the big lessons in finding absolute extreme values is the realization that the interval we choose has nearly the same impact on the problem as the function under consideration.  Consider, for instance, the function pictured in Figure~\ref{F:3.3.Interval}.

\begin{marginfigure}[1cm] % MARGIN FIGURE
\margingraphics{figures/3_3_Interval.eps}
\caption{A function $g$ considered on three different intervals.} \label{F:3.3.Interval}
\end{marginfigure}

In sequence, from left to right, as we see the interval under consideration change from $[-2,3]$ to $[-2,2]$ to $[-2,1]$, we move from having two critical values in the interval with the absolute minimum at one critical value and the absolute maximum at the right endpoint, to still having both critical numbers in the interval but then with the absolute minimum and maximum at the two critical values, to finally having just one critical value in the interval with the absolute maximum at one critical value and the absolute minimum at one endpoint.  It is particularly essential to always remember to only consider the critical values that lie within the interval.

\subsection*{Moving towards applications}

In Section~\ref{S:3.4.AppliedOpt}, we will focus almost exclusively on applied optimization problems:  problems where we seek to find the absolute maximum or minimum value of a function that represents some physical situation.  We conclude this current section with an example of one such problem because it highlights the role that a closed, bounded domain can play in finding absolute extrema.  In addition, these problems often involve considerable preliminary work to develop the function which is to be optimized, and this example demonstrates that process.

\input{examples/3-3_Eg1} % EXAMPLE

\input{activities/3.3.Act3} %ACTIVITY

The approaches shown in Example~\ref{Ex:3.3.Eg1} and experienced in Activity~\ref{A:3.3.3} include standard steps that we undertake in almost every applied optimization problem:  we draw a picture to demonstrate the situation, introduce one or more variables to represent quantities that are changing, work to find a function that models the quantity to be optimized, and then decide an appropriate domain for that function.  Once that work is done, we are in the familiar situation of finding the absolute minimum and maximum of a function over a particular domain, at which time we apply the calculus ideas that we have been studying to this point in Chapter~\ref{CH:3}.

% SUMMARY
%--------------
\begin{summary}
\item To find relative extreme values of a function, we normally use a first derivative sign chart and classify all of the function's critical values.  If instead we are interested in absolute extreme values, we first decide whether we are considering the entire domain of the function or a particular interval.  
\item In the case of finding global extremes over the function's entire domain, we again use a first or second derivative sign chart in an effort to make overall conclusions about whether or not the function can have a absolute maximum or minimum.
If we are working to find absolute extremes on a restricted interval, then we first identify all critical values of the function that lie in the interval.
\item For a continuous function on a closed, bounded interval, the only possible points at which absolute extreme values occur are the critical values and the endpoints.  Thus, to find said absolute extremes, we simply evaluate the function at each endpoint and each critical value in the interval, and then we compare the results to decide which is largest (the absolute maximum) and which is smallest (the absolute minimum).
