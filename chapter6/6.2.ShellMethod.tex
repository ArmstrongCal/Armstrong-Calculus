\subsection*{Introduction}

Often a given problem can be solved in more than one way. A particular method may be chosen out of convenience, personal preference, or perhaps necessity. Ultimately, it is good to have options.

The previous section introduced the Disk and Washer Methods, which computed the volume of solids of revolution by integrating the cross-sectional area of the solid. This section develops another method of computing volume, the \textbf{Shell Method.} Instead of slicing the solid perpendicular to the axis of rotation creating cross-sections, we now slice it parallel to the axis of rotation, creating ``shells.''

The Preview Activity \ref{PA:6.2} introduces a situation where using the Washer Method from Section \ref{S:6.1.Volume} becomes very tedious.

Consider Figure~\ref{fig:6.2.shell}-(a), where the region shown rotated around the $y$-axis forming the solid shown in Figure~\ref{fig:6.2.shell}-(b). A small slice of the region is drawn in Figure~\ref{fig:6.2.shell}-(a), parallel to the axis of rotation. When the region is rotated, this thin slice forms a \textbf{cylindrical shell}, as pictured in Figure~\ref{fig:6.2.shell}-(c). The previous section approximated a solid with lots of thin disks (or washers); we now approximate a solid with many thin cylindrical shells. 

To compute the volume of one shell, first consider the paper label on a soup can with radius $r$ and height $h$. What is the area of this label? A simple way of determining this is to cut the label and lay it out flat, forming a rectangle with height $h$ and length $2\pi r$. Thus the area is $A = 2\pi rh$; see Figure~\ref{F:6.2.soupcan}-(a).

Do a similar process with a cylindrical shell, with height $h$, thickness $\Delta x$, and approximate radius $r$. Cutting the shell and laying it flat forms a rectangular solid with length $2\pi r$, height $h$ and depth $\dx$. Thus the volume is $V \approx 2\pi rh\dx$; see Figure~\ref{F:6.2.soupcan}-(b). (We say ``approximately'' since our radius was an approximation.)

By breaking the solid into $n$ cylindrical shells, we can approximate the volume of the solid as
$$V = \sum_{i=1}^n 2\pi r_ih_i\dx_i,$$ where $r_i$, $h_i$ and $\dx_i$ are the radius, height and thickness of the $i\,^\text{th}$ shell, respectively. 

This is a Riemann Sum. Taking a limit as the thickness of the shells approaches $0$ leads to a definite integral.

\concept{The Shell Method} % CONCEPT
{Let a solid be formed by revolving a region $R$, bounded by $x=a$ and $x=b$, around a vertical axis. Let $r(x)$ represent the distance from the axis of rotation to $x$ (i.e., the radius of a sample shell) and let $h(x)$ represent the height of the solid at $x$ (i.e., the height of the shell). The volume of the solid is 
\index{integration!volume!Shell Method}\index{Shell Method}
$$V = 2\pi\int_a^b r(x)h(x)\ dx.$$
} %end CONCEPT

\textbf{Special Cases:}
\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item When the region $R$ is bounded above by $y=f(x)$ and below by $y=g(x)$, then $h(x) = f(x)-g(x)$.
\item	When the axis of rotation is the $y$-axis (i.e., $x=0$) then $r(x) = x$.
\end{enumerate}
	
Let's practice using the Shell Method.

\input{examples/6-2_Eg1.tex} % EXAMPLE

With the Shell Method, nothing special needs to be accounted for to compute the volume of a solid that has a hole in the middle, as demonstrated next.

\input{examples/6-2_Eg2.tex} % EXAMPLE

\input{activities/6.2.Act1.tex} % ACTIVITY

When revolving a region around a horizontal axis, we must consider the radius and height functions in terms of $y$, not $x$.

\input{examples/6-2_Eg3.tex} % EXAMPLE

\input{activities/6.2.Act2.tex} % ACTIVITY

At the beginning of this section it was stated that ``it is good to have options.'' The next example finds the volume of a solid rather easily with the Shell Method, but using the Washer Method would be quite a chore.

% SUMMARY
%--------------------------------------------
\begin{summary}
  \item We can use a definite integral to find the volume of a three-dimensional solid of revolution that results from revolving a two-dimensional region about a particular axis by taking  slices parallel to the axis of revolution which will then be cylindrical shells.
  \item If we revolve about a vertical line and slice perpendicular to that line, then our shells are vertical and of thickness $\triangle x$. This leads us to integrate with respect to $x$.
	\item If we revolve about a horizontal line and slice parallel to that line, then our shells are horizontal and of thickness $\triangle y$. This leads us to integrate with respect to $y$, as opposed to with respect to $x$ when we slice a solid vertically.
	\item Let a region $R$ be given with $x$-bounds $x=a$ and $x=b$ and $y$-bounds $y=c$ and $y=d$.
