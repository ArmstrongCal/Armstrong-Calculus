Just as we can use definite integrals to add up the areas of rectangular slices to find the exact area that lies between two curves, we can also employ integrals to determine the volume of certain regions that have cross-sections of a particular consistent shape.  As a very elementary example, consider a cylinder of radius $2$ and height $3$, as pictured in Figure~\ref{F:6.1.Intro}.  While we know that we can compute the area of any circular cylinder by the formula $V = \pi r^2 h$, if we think about slicing the cylinder into thin pieces, we see that each is a cylinder of radius $r = 2$ and height (thickness) $\triangle x$.  Hence, the volume of a representative slice is
$$V_{\small{\text{slice}}} = \pi \cdot 2^2 \cdot \triangle x.$$
Letting $\triangle x \to 0$ and using a definite integral to add the volumes of the slices, we find that 
$$V = \int_0^3 \pi \cdot 2^2 \, dx.$$
Moreover, since $\ds\int_0^3 4\pi \, dx = 12\pi$, we have found that the volume of the cylinder is $4\pi$.  The principal problem of interest in our upcoming work will be to find the volume of certain solids whose cross-sections are all thin cylinders (or washers) and to do so by using a definite integral.  To that end, we first consider another familiar shape in Preview Activity~\ref{PA:6.1}: a circular cone.

\subsection*{The Volume of a Solid of Revolution} \index{solid of revolution}

A solid of revolution is a three dimensional solid that can be generated by revolving one or more curves around a fixed axis.  For example, we can think of a circular cylinder as a solid of revolution:  in Figure~\ref{F:6.1.Intro}, this could be accomplished by revolving the area between the $x$-axis and the line segment from $(0,2)$ to $(3,2)$ about the $x$-axis.  Likewise, the circular cone in Figure~\ref{F:PA.6.1} is the solid of revolution generated by revolving the area between the $x$-axis and the portion of the line $y = 3 - \frac{3}{5}x$ from $x = 0$ to $x = 5$ about the $x$-axis.  It is particularly important to notice in any solid of revolution that if we slice the solid perpendicular to the axis of revolution, the resulting cross-section is circular.

We consider two examples to highlight some of the natural issues that arise in determining the volume of a solid of revolution.

\input{examples/6-1_Eg1.tex} %EXAMPLE

For a solid such as the one in Example~\ref{eg:6.1.1}, where each cross-section is a cylindrical disk, we first find the volume of a typical cross-section (noting particularly how this volume depends on $x$), and then we integrate over the range of $x$-values through which we slice the solid in order to find the exact total volume.  Often, we will be content with simply finding the integral that represents the sought volume; if we desire a numeric value for the integral, we typically use a calculator or computer algebra system to find that value.

The general principle we are using to find the volume of a solid of revolution generated by a single curve is often called the \emph{disk method}\index{disk method}.

\concept{Disk Method}{  % CONCEPT
If $y = r(x)$ is a nonnegative continuous function on $[a,b]$, then the volume of the solid of revolution generated by revolving the region bounded by the function and the $x$-axis about the $x$-axis over this interval is given by
$$V = \int_a^b \pi \left[ r(x) \right]^2 \, dx.$$
} %end CONCEPT

\input{examples/6-1_Eg2.tex} %EXAMPLE

A different type of solid can emerge when two curves are involved, as we see in the following example.

\input{examples/6-1_Eg3.tex} % EXAMPLE

The general principle we are using to find the volume of a solid of revolution generated by revolving a region bounded by two curves is often called the \emph{washer method}\index{washer method}.

\concept{Washer Method}{ % CONCEPT
If $y = R(x)$ and $y = r(x)$ are nonnegative continuous functions on $[a,b]$ that satisfy $R(x) \ge r(x)$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$, then the volume of the solid of revolution generated by revolving the region between them about the $x$-axis over this interval is given by
$$V = \int_a^b \pi [R(x)^2 - r(x)^2] \, dx.$$

% SUBSECTION REVOLVING ABOUT THE Y-AXIS
%--------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Revolving about the $y$-axis}

As seen in Activity~\ref{A:6.1.1}, problem~(e), the problem changes considerably when we revolve a given region about the $y$-axis.  Foremost, this is due to the fact that representative slices now have thickness $\triangle y$, which means that it becomes necessary to integrate with respect to $y$.  Let's consider a particular example to demonstrate some of the key issues.

% SUBSECTION REVOLVING ABOUT OTHER LINES
%--------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Revolving about horizontal and vertical lines other than the coordinate axes}

Just as we can revolve about one of the coordinate axes ($y = 0$ or $x = 0$), it is also possible to revolve around any horizontal or vertical line.  Doing so essentially adjusts the radii of cylinders or washers involved by a constant value.  A careful, well-labeled plot of the solid of revolution will usually reveal how the different axis of revolution affects the definite integral we set up.  Again, an example is instructive.

\subsection*{Volumes of Other Solids}

Given an arbitrary solid, we can \textit{approximate} its volume by cutting it into $n$  thin slices. When the slices are thin, each slice can be approximated by a right cylinder with known cross-sectional area . Thus the volume of each slice is approximately its cross-sectional area $\times$ thickness. (These slices are the differential elements.)

By orienting a solid along the $x$-axis, we can let $A(x_i)$ represent the cross-sectional area
of the $i\,^\text{th}$ slice, and let $\dx_i$ represent the thickness of this slice (the thickness is a small change in $x$). The total volume of the solid is approximately:
\begin{align*} \text{Volume} &\approx \sum_{i=1}^n \Big[\text{Area}\ \times\ \text{thickness}\Big] \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n A(x_i)\dx_i.
\end{align*}
	
Recognize that this is a Riemann Sum. By taking a limit (as the thickness of the slices goes to $0$) we can find the volume exactly. 

\concept{Volume By Cross-Sectional Area} % CONCEPT
{The volume $V$ of a solid, oriented along the $x$-axis with cross-sectional area $A(x)$ from $x=a$ to $x=b$, is \index{integration!volume!cross-sectional area}
$$V = \int_a^b A(x)\ dx.$$

% SUMMARY
%-------------
\begin{summary}
  \item We can use a definite integral to find the volume of a three-dimensional solid of revolution that results from revolving a two-dimensional region about a particular axis by taking slices perpendicular to the axis of revolution which will then be circular disks or washers.
  \item If we revolve about a vertical line and slice perpendicular to that line, then our slices are horizontal and of thickness $\triangle y$. This leads us to integrate with respect to $y$, as opposed to with respect to $x$ when we slice a solid vertically.
  \item If we revolve about a line other than the $x$- or $y$-axis, we need to carefully account for the shift that occurs in the radius of a typical slice.  Normally, this shift involves taking a sum or difference of the function along with the constant connected to the equation for the horizontal or vertical line; a well-labeled diagram is usually the best way to decide the new expression for the radius.
