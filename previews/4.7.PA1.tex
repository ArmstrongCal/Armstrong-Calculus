\begin{pa} \label{PA:4.7}  Consider the following test scores of a particular student.
\[ 83, \enskip 75, \enskip 92, \enskip 68 \]

\ba
\item Calculate the student's average test score.
\item Would the method used in (a) to determine the average score change depending on the number of tests?
\item Is it necessarily the case that the student's average test score must equal exactly one of their actual test scores? Why or why not?
\ea

\noindent Consider a circle of radius $5$ and a square of side length $2$.

\ba
\item Compute the areas of the circle and square.
\item Suppose the square is placed wholly inside the circle.  How would you compute the area of the region inside the circle but outside the square?  What is the area of that region?
