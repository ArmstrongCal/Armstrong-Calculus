	\item Identify all of the values of $c$ for which $h(c)$ is a local maximum of $h$.
	\item Identify all of the values of $c$ for which $h(c)$ is a local minimum of $h$.
	\item Does $h$ have a global maximum?  If so, what is the value of this global maximum?
	\item Does $h$ have a global minimum?  If so, what is its value?
	\item Identify all values of $c$ for which $h'(c) = 0$.
	\item Identify all values of $c$ for which $h'(c)$ does not exist.
	\item True or false: every relative maximum and minimum of $h$ occurs at a point where $h'(c)$ is either zero or does not exist.
	\item True or false: at every point where $h'(c)$ is zero or does not exist, $h$ has a relative maximum or minimum.
