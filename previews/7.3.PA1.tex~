Let's consider the initial value problem 
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{dy}{dt} & = & t - 2 \\
y(0) & = & 1
\end{eqnarray*}

\ba
\item Use the differential equation to find the slope of the tangent
  line to the solution $y(t)$ at $t=0$.  Then use the initial value to
  find the equation of the tangent line at $t=0$.  Sketch this tangent
  line over the interval $-0.25\leq t\leq0.25$ below.

\item Also shown above are the tangent lines to the solution $y(t)$ at
  the points $t=1, 2$, and $3$ (we will see how to find these later).
  Measure the slope of each tangent line  
  and verify that it agrees with that specified by the differential
  equation.  

\item Use these tangent lines as a guide, sketch a graph of the
  solution $y(t)$ over the interval $0\leq t\leq 3$.

\item Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to find $y(t)$, the
  solution to this initial value problem.

\item Graph the solution you found above and compare it to the sketch
  you made using the tangent lines.
