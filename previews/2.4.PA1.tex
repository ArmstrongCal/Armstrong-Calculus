Functions of the form $f(x) = x^n$, where $n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots$, are often called \emph{power functions}.  The first two questions below revisit work we did earlier, and the following questions extend those ideas to higher powers of $x$.
\ba
	\item Use the limit definition of the derivative to find $f'(x)$ for $f(x) = x^2$.
	\item Use the limit definition of the derivative to find $f'(x)$ for $f(x) = x^3$.
	\item Use the limit definition of the derivative to find $f'(x)$ for $f(x) = x^4$.  (Hint: $(a+b)^4 = a^4 + 4a^3b + 6a^2b^2 + 4ab^3 + b^4$.  Apply this rule to $(x+h)^4$ within the limit definition.)
	\item Based on your work in (a), (b), and (c), what do you conjecture is the derivative of $f(x) = x^5$?  Of $f(x) = x^{13}$?
	\item Conjecture a formula for the derivative of $f(x) = x^n$ that holds for any positive integer $n$.  That is, given $f(x) = x^n$ where $n$ is a positive integer, what do you think is the formula for $f'(x)$?
