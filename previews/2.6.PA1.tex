\begin{pa} \label{PA:2.6}
For each function given below, identify its fundamental algebraic structure.  In particular, is the given function a sum, product, quotient, or composition of basic functions?  If the function is a composition of basic functions, state a formula for the functions that make up the composition so that the overall composite function can be written in the form $f(g(x))$.  If the function is a sum, product, or quotient of basic functions, use the appropriate rule to determine its derivative.
