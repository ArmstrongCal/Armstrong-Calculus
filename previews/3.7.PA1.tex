Let $h$ be the function given by $\ds h(x) = \frac{x^5 + x - 2}{x^2 - 1}$.
\ba
	\item What is the domain of $h$?
	\item Explain why $\displaystyle\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^5 + x
- 2}{x^2 - 1}$ results in an indeterminate form.
	\item Next we will investigate the behavior of both the numerator and denominator of $h$ near the point where $x = 1$.  Let $f(x) = x^5 + x - 2$
and $g(x) = x^2 - 1$. Find the local linearizations of $f$ and $g$ at $a = 1$, and call these functions $L_f(x)$ and $L_g(x)$, respectively.
	\item Explain why $\ds h(x) \approx \frac{L_f(x)}{L_g(x)}$ for $x$ near $a = 1$.
	\item Using your work from (c) and (d), evaluate 
	$$\lim_{x \to 1} \frac{L_f(x)}{L_g(x)}.$$
	What do you think your result tells us about $\ds \lim_{x \to 1} h(x)$?
	\item Investigate the function $h(x)$ graphically and numerically near $x = 1$.  What do you think is the value of $\ds \lim_{x \to 1} h(x)$?
