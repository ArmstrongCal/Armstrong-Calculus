\begin{pa} \label{PA:2.4}
Consider the function $\ds f(x) = \tan(x)$, and remember that $\tan(x) = \frac{\sin(x)}{\cos(x)}$.
\ba
	\item What is the domain of $f$?
	\item Use the quotient rule to show that one expression for $f'(x)$ is
	$$f'(x) = \frac{\cos(x)\cos(x) + \sin(x)\sin(x)}{\cos^2(x)}.$$
	\item What is the Fundamental Trigonometric Identity?  How can this identity be used to find a simpler form for $f'(x)$?
	\item Recall that $\sec(x) = \frac{1}{\cos(x)}$.  How can we express $f'(x)$ in terms of the secant function?
	\item For what values of $x$ is $f'(x)$ defined?  How does this set compare to the domain of $f$?
