\begin{pa} \label{PA:6.3}  In the following, we consider the function $f(x)=1-x^2$ over the interval $[-1,1]$. Our goal is to estimate the length of the curve. 

\ba
\item Graph $f(x)$ over the interval $[-1,1]$. Label the points on the curve that correspond to $x=-1,-\frac12,0,1/2$, and $1$.  

\item Draw the secant line connecting the points $(-1,f(-1)$ and \newline $(-\frac{1}{2},f(-\frac{1}{2}))$. Use the distance formula to find the length of the secant line from $x=-1$ to $x=-\frac12$.
\item Repeat drawing a secant line between the remaining points starting with $(-\frac{1}{2},f(-\frac{1}{2}))$ and $(0,f(0))$. For each line segment , use the distance formula to find the length of the segment.
\item Add the distances together to get an approximation to the length of the curve. 
\item How can we improve our approximation? Write a Riemann sum that will give an improvement to our approximation.
