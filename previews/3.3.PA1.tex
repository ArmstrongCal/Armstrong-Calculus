\begin{pa} \label{PA:3.3}
Let $\ds f(x) = 2 + \frac{3}{1+(x+1)^2}$.
\ba
	\item Determine all of the critical values of $f$.
	\item Construct a first derivative sign chart for $f$ and thus determine all intervals on which $f$ is increasing or decreasing.
	\item Does $f$ have a global maximum?  If so, why, and what is its value and where is the maximum attained?  If not, explain why.
	\item Determine $\ds \lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)$ and $\ds \lim_{x \to -\infty} f(x)$.
	\item Explain why $f(x) > 2$ for every value of $x$.
	\item Does $f$ have a global minimum?  If so, why, and what is its value and where is the minimum attained?  If not, explain why.
