\begin{pa} \label{PA:3.5}
On a recent vacation trip, Michelle traveled 200 miles on a toll road in 3 hours. 
\ba
	\item Plot points on the graph to represent Michelle's distance traveled, d, at a given time, t, where $t=0$ represents the time she started driving on the toll road.  
	\item Draw a possible distance function, d(t), on the graph.  
	\item On the second graph, plot Michelle's velocity, v(t). What was her average velocity during the trip?
	\item Based on the distance function, does she ever exceed this average velocity? If yes, explain by finding a time where she exceeds the average velocity. If not, explain why.
	\item If Michelle had to stop to pay her toll when entering the toll road, does she ever exceed the average velocity?
