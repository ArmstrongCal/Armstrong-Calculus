\begin{pa} \label{PA:7.1}
Let's imagine a object in motion with its position given by the
function $x(t)$, where $x$ is measured in feet and $t$ in seconds.  We
determine that the velocity is $v(t) = 4t + 1$ feet per second.
\ba
\item How much does the position change over the time interval
  $[0,4]$?
\item Does this give you enough information to determine $x(4)$, the
  position at time $t=4$?  If so, what is $x(4)$?  If not, what
  additional information would you need to know to determine $x(4)$?
\item Suppose you are told that the object's initial position $x(0) =
  7$.  Determine $x(2)$, the object's position 2 seconds later.
\item If you are told instead that the object's initial position is
  $x(0) = 3$, what is $x(2)$?
\item If all we know is the velocity $v(t)=4t+1$, is it possible that the
  object's position at all times is $x(t) = 2t^2 + t$?  Explain how
  you know.
\item Are there other possibilities for $x(t)$?  If so, what are they?  
\item If we know the initial position $x(0)$, how many possibilities
  are there for $x(t)$?
