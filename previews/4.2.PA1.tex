\begin{pa} \label{PA:4.2}
A person walking along a straight path has her velocity in miles per hour at time $t$ given by the function $v(t) = 0.25t^3-1.5t^2+3t+0.25$, for times in the interval $0 \le t \le 2$.  The graph of this function is also given in each of the three diagrams. Note that in each diagram, we use four rectangles to estimate the area under $y = v(t)$ on the interval $[0,2]$, but the method by which the four rectangles' respective heights are decided varies among the three individual graphs.
\ba
\item How are the heights of rectangles in the left-most diagram being chosen?  Explain, and hence determine the value of 
\[ S = A_1 + A_2 + A_3 + A_4 \]
by evaluating the function $y = v(t)$ at appropriately chosen values and observing the width of each rectangle.  Note, for example, that 
\[ A_3 = v(1) \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 2 \cdot \frac{1}{2} = 1. \]

\item Explain how the heights of rectangles are being chosen in the middle diagram and find the value of
\[ T = B_1 + B_2 + B_3 + B_4. \]

\item Likewise, determine the pattern of how heights of rectangles are chosen in the right-most diagram and determine
\[ U = C_1 + C_2 + C_3 + C_4. \]
	
\item Of the estimates $S$, $T$, and $U$, which do you think is the best approximation of $D$, the total distance the person traveled on $[0,2]$?  Why?
