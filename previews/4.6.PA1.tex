In Section~\ref{S:2.6.Chain}, we learned the Chain Rule and how it can be applied to find the derivative of a composite function.  In particular, if $g$ is a differentiable function of $x$, and $f$ is a differentiable function of $g(x)$, then
$$\frac{d}{dx} \left[ f(g(x))  \right] = f'(g(x)) \cdot g'(x).$$
In words, we say that the derivative of a composite function $c(x) = f(g(x))$, where $f$ is considered the ``outer'' function and $g(x)$ the ``inner'' function, is ``the derivative of the outer function, evaluated at the inner function, times the derivative of the inner function.''  

For each of the following functions, use the Chain Rule to find the function's derivative.
\ba
\item $f(x) = e^{3x^2}$
\item $h(x) = \sin(3x + 4)$
\item $p(x) = \arctan\left( \sqrt{x} \right)$
\item $q(x) = (2-7x)^4$
\item $r(x) = \ln \left( 4-11x^3 \right)$
