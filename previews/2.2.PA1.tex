\begin{pa} \label{PA:1.4}
Consider the function $f(x) = 4x - x^2$.
\ba
	\item Use the limit definition to compute the following derivative values:  $f'(0)$, $f'(1)$, $f'(2)$, and $f'(3)$.
	\item Observe that the work to find $f'(a)$ is the same, regardless of the value of $a$.  Based on your work in (a), what do you conjecture is the value of $f'(4)$?  How about $f'(5)$?  (Note: you should \emph{not} use the limit definition of the derivative to find either value.)
	\item Conjecture a formula for $f'(a)$ that depends only on the value $a$.  That is, in the same way that we have a formula for $f(x)$ (recall $f(x) = 4x - x^2$), see if you can use your work above to guess a formula for $f'(a)$ in terms of $a$.
