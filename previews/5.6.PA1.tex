As we begin to investigate ways to approximate definite integrals, it will be insightful to compare results to integrals whose exact values we know.  To that end, the following sequence of questions centers on $\int_0^3 x^2 \, dx$. 
\ba
	\item Use the applet at \href{http://gvsu.edu/s/dP}{\texttt{http://gvsu.edu/s/dP}} with the function $f(x) = x^2$ on the window of $x$ values from $0$ to $3$ and $y$ values from $-1$ to $10$, to compute $L_3$, the left Riemann sum with three subintervals.
	\item Likewise, use the applet to compute $R_3$ and $M_3$, the right and middle Riemann sums with three subintervals, respectively.
	\item Use the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus to compute the exact value of $I = \int_0^3 x^2 \, dx$.
	\item We define the \emph{error} in an approximation of a definite integral to be the difference between the integral's exact value and the approximation's value.  What is the error that results from using $L_3$? From $R_3$?  From $M_3$?
	\item In what follows in this section, we will learn a new approach to estimating the value of a definite integral known as the Trapezoid Rule.  For now, use the ``Trapezoid'' option  in the applet in the pull-down menu for the ``Method'' of estimating the definite integral, and determine the approximation generated by 3 trapezoids.  What is the error in this approximation?  How does it compare to the errors you calculated in (d)?
	\item What is the formula for the area of a trapezoid with bases of length $b_1$ and $b_2$ and height $h$?
