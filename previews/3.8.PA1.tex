The graph of $f(x)$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig:3.8.PA1}.

	\item Draw the tangent line to $f(x)$ at $x=a_0$ and extend the tangent line until it intersects the $x$ axis. 
	\item Label the $x$-intecept of the tangent line as $a_1$. What do you notice about $a_1$ and the root of $f(x)$?
	\item Now draw the tangent line to $f(x)$ at $x=a_1$ and extend the tangent line until it intersects the $x$ axis.
	\item  Label the $x$-intecept of the tangent line as $a_2$. What do you notice about $a_2$ and the root of $f(x)$?
	\item If we continue this process, what do think happens to the distance between $a_n$ and the root of $f(x)$?
