\begin{pa} \label{PA:6.2}  Consider the function $f(x)=x^2-x^3$, whose graph is in Figure~\ref{F:PA.6.2}.  Our goal in this activity is to use a definite integral to determine the volume of the solid formed by revolving the region bounded by $f(x)$ and $y=0$ about the $y$-axis.

\ba
\item Using the Washer Method, find an expression for the inner and outer radii of a slice.
\item Set up a definite integral to find the volume. If you try to evaluate the integral, what do you notice that happens? 
\item Find where the local maximum occurs.  
\item Use the results of past c) to split the solid into two pieces. Set up two definite integrals to find the volume of the original solid.
