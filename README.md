# Armstrong-Calculus
An open-source textbook for calculus.

This repository contains the source and output files of an open-source calculus textbook created by Drs. Jared Schlieper and 
Michael Tiemeyer of Armstrong State University in Savannah, GA.  The text is mostly an adaptation of two other excellent open-
source calculus textbooks:  Active Calculus by Dr. Matt Boelkins of Grand Valley State University and Drs. Gregory Hartman, 
Brian Heinold, Troy Siemers, Dimplekumar Chalishajar, and Jennifer Bowen of the Virginia Military Institute and Mount Saint
Mary's University.  Both of these texts can be found at http://aimath.org/textbooks/approved-textbooks/.

The authors of this text have combined sections, examples, and exercises from the above two texts along with some of their 
own content to generate this text.  The impetus for the creation of this text was to adopt an open-source textbook for 
Calculus while maintaining the typical schedule and content of the calculus sequence at our home institution.
