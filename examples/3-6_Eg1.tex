\begin{example} \label{Ex:3.6.Eg1}
Consider $f(x) = x^2$. Knowing $f(3) = 9$, approximate $f(3.1)$.

\solution The $x$ value is changing from $x=3$ to $x=3.1$; therefore, we see that $dx=0.1$. If we know how much the $y$ value changes from $f(3)$ to $f(3.1)$ (i.e., if we know $\dy$), we will know exactly what $f(3.1)$ is (since we already know $f(3)$). We can approximate $\dy$ with $dy$.
\begin{align*} 
\dy &\approx dy \\
&= \fp(3)dx \\
&= 2\cdot 3\cdot 0.1 = 0.6.
\end{align*}

We expect the $y$ value to change by about $0.6$, so we approximate $f(3.1) \approx 9.6.$

We leave it to the reader to verify this, but the preceding discussion links the differential to the tangent line of $f(x)$ at $x=3$. One can verify that the tangent line, evaluated at $x=3.1$, also gives $y=9.6$.
