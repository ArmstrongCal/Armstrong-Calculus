Sketch the slope field for the differential equation $y' = x(1-y)$?

\solution We can use the method mentioned in this section by finding the slope of the tangent line at several points in the plane. This process is very tedious, so instead we a CAS(computer algebra system) like Sage or Wolfram Alpha. Figure \ref{F:DE.1.2} shows the slope field generated with Sage.
