\begin{example} \label{Ex:2.5.Eg2}
Use the Product Rule to compute the derivative of $y=5x^2\sin(x)$. Evaluate the derivative at $x=\pi/2$.

\solution To make our use of the Product Rule explicit, let's set $f(x) = 5x^2$ and $g(x) = \sin(x)$. We easily compute/recall that $\fp(x) = 10x$ and $g'(x) = \cos(x)$. Employing the rule, we have $$\frac{d}{dx}\Big(5x^2\sin(x)\Big) = 5x^2\cos(x) + 10x\sin(x).$$

At $x=\pi/2$, we have 
\[ y'(\pi/2) = 5\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right)^2\cos \left(\frac{\pi}2\right) + 10\frac{\pi}2 \sin\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\right) = 5\pi.\] 
We graph $y$ and its tangent line at $x=\pi/2$, which has a slope of $5\pi$, in Figure \ref{F:2.5_Eg5}. While this does not \textit{prove} that the Produce Rule is the correct way to handle derivatives of products, it helps validate its truth.
