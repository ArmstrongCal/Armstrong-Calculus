\begin{example} \label{Ex:2.6.Eg2}
Let $C(x) = \sin(2x).$  Use the double angle identity to rewrite $C$ as a product of basic functions, and use the product rule to find $C'$.  Rewrite $C'$ in the simplest form possible.  

\solution By the double angle identity for the sine function,
$$C(x) = \sin(2x) = 2\sin(x)\cos(x).$$
Applying the product rule and simplifying,
$$C'(x) = 2\sin(x)(-\sin(x)) + \cos(x)(2\cos(x)) = 2(\cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x)).$$
Next, we recall that one of the double angle identities for the cosine function tells us that 
$$\cos(2x) = \cos^2(x) - \sin^2(x).$$
Substituting this result in our expression for $C'(x)$, we now have that $\ds C'(x) = 2 \cos(2x)$.
