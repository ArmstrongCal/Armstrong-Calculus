\begin{example} \label{Ex:1.1.Eg6}
Explore why $\ds \lim_{x\to 1} \frac{1}{(x-1)^2}$ does not exist.

\solution A graph of $\ds f(x) = \frac{1}{(x-1)^2}$ is given in Figure~\ref{fig:1-1_Eg6}. It shows that as $x$ approaches 1, $f(x)$ grows without bound in the positive direction. 

We can deduce this on our own, without the aid of the graph or table. If $x$ is near 1, then $(x-1)^2$ is very small, and: 
\[ \frac{1}{\text{very small number}} \rightarrow \text{very large number}.\]
Since $f(x)$ is not approaching a single number (growing without bound), we conclude that 
\[ \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{1}{(x-1)^2} \] 
does not exist.
