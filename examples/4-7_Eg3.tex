\begin{example}  % EXAMPLE 
Consider $\int_0^\pi \sin x\ dx$. Find a value $c$ guaranteed by the Mean Value Theorem.

\solution We first need to evaluate $\int_0^\pi \sin x\ dx$. (This was previously done in Example \ref{ex_ftc4}.)
\[ \int_0^\pi\sin x\ dx =	-\cos x \Big|_0^\pi = 2. \]
Thus we seek a value $c$ in $[0,\pi]$ such that $\pi\sin c =2$. 
\[ \pi\sin c = 2\ \ \Rightarrow\ \ \sin c = 2/\pi\ \ \Rightarrow\ \ c = \arcsin(2/\pi) \approx 0.69. \]
In Figure \ref{fig:ftc8} $\sin x$ is sketched along with a rectangle with height $\sin (0.69)$. The area of the rectangle is the same as the area under $\sin x$ on $[0,\pi]$.
