\begin{example} \label{Ex:2.6.Eg4}
Suppose three friends $x$, $y$, and $u$ are chopping wood, and they chop at different rates.  If $y$ chops twice as fast as $u$ and $u$ chops six times as fast as $x$, 	
how much is faster is $y$ chopping wood than $x$?

\solution
 If $y$ chops twice as fast as $u$, then we can write the rate at which $y$ chops wood with respect to $u$ as 
	\[ \ds \frac{dy}{du} = 2. \] 
"The rate of change of y with respect to u is 2."
If $u$ chops six times as fast as $x$, then we can write the rate at which $u$ chops wood with respect to $x$ as \[ \ds \frac{du}{dx} = 6. \] 
"The rate of change of u with respect to x is 6."
By asking how much faster is $y$ chopping than $x$,  we want to know 
"The rate of change of y with respect to x."
The rate of change of $y$ with respect to $x$ is
	\[ \ds \frac{dy}{dx}. \] 	
	We can find it by multiplying the rate at which $y$ chops wood with respect to $u$ and the rate at which $u$ chops wood with respect to $x$, yielding:
	\[ \ds \frac{dy}{dx} = \frac{dy}{du} \cdot \frac{du}{dx} . \] 
So we have that $y$ chops $12 = 2 \cdot 6$ times faster $y$ chops than $x$.
