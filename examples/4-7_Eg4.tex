\begin{example} % EXAMPLE
An object moves back and forth along a straight line with a velocity given by $v(t) = (t-1)^2$ on $[0,3]$, where $t$ is measured in seconds and $v(t)$ is measured in ft/s. 

What is the average velocity of the object?

\solution By our definition, the average velocity is:
\[ \frac{1}{3-0}\int_0^3 (t-1)^2\ dt =\frac13 \int_0^3 \big(t^2-2t+1\big)\ dt = \left.\frac13\left(\frac13t^3-t^2+t\right)\right|_0^3 = 1\text{ ft/s}. \]
