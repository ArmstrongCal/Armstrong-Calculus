\begin{example}\label{Ex:1.3.Eg1} %%Finding intervals of continuity 
Let $f$ be defined as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:1-3_Eg1}. Give the interval(s) on which $f$ is continuous.

\solution We proceed by examining the three criteria for continuity.
\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item The limits $\ds \lim_{x \to a} f(x)$ exists for all $a$ between $0$ and $3$.
\item $f(a)$ is defined for all $a$ between $0$ and $3$, \textit{except for} $a=1$. We know immediately that $f$ cannot be continuous at $x=1$.
\item The limit $\ds \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$ for all $a$ between $0$ and $3$, except, of course, for $a=1$. 
\item The function is defined at both $x = 0$ and $x = 3$, and both $\ds\lim_{x \to 0^+} f(x) = f(0)$ and $\ds\lim_{x \to 3^-} f(x) = f(3)$.
\end{enumerate}

Therefore, we conclude that $f$ is continuous at every point of $[0,3]$ except at $x=1$. Therefore $f$ is continuous on $[0,1)$ and $(1,3]$.
