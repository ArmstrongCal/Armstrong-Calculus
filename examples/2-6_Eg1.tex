\begin{example} \label{Ex:2.6.Eg1}
Let $f(x) = -4x + 7$ and $g(x) = 3x - 5$.  Determine a formula for $C(x) = f(g(x))$ and compute $C'(x)$.  How is $C'$ related to $f$ and $g$ and their derivatives?

\solution By the rules given for $f$ and $g$, 
\begin{align*}
C(x) & =  f(g(x)) \\
& =  f(3x-5) \\
& =  -4(3x-5) + 7 \\
& =  -12x + 20 + 7 \\
& =  -12x + 27.
\end{align*}
Thus, $C'(x) = -12$.  Noting that $f'(x) = -4$ and $g'(x) = 3$, we observe that $C'$ appears to be the product of $f'$ and $g'$.
