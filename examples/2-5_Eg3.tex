\begin{example} \label{Ex:2.5.Eg3}
Use the Product Rule to compute the derivative of $P(z) = z^3 \cdot \cos(z)$. 

\solution The first function is $z^3$ and the second function is $\cos(z)$.  By the product rule, $P'$ will be given by the first, $z^3$, times the derivative of the second, $-\sin(z)$, plus the second, $\cos(z)$, times the derivative of the first,  $3z^2$.  That is,
\[ P'(z) = z^3(-\sin(z)) + \cos(z) 3z^2 = -z^3 \sin(z) + 3z^2 \cos(z).\]
