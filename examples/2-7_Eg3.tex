\begin{example} \label{Ex:2.7.Eg3}
Given the implicitly defined function $\sin(x^2y^2)+y^3=x+y$, find $y'$.

\solution
Differentiating term by term, we find the most difficulty in the first term.  It requires both the Chain and Product Rules.
		\begin{align*}
		\frac{d}{dx}\Big(\sin(x^2y^2)\Big) &= \cos(x^2y^2)\cdot\frac{d}{dx}\Big(x^2y^2\Big) \\
																				&= \cos(x^2y^2)\cdot\big(x^2(2yy')+2xy^2\big)\\
																				&= 2(x^2yy'+xy^2)\cos(x^2y^2).
		\end{align*}  

We leave the derivatives of the other terms to the reader. After taking the derivatives of both sides, we have
$$2(x^2yy'+xy^2)\cos(x^2y^2) + 3y^2y' = 1 + y'.$$

We now have to be careful to properly solve for $y'$, particularly because of the product on the left.  It is best to multiply out the product.  Doing this, we get
$$2x^2y\cos(x^2y^2)y' + 2xy^2\cos(x^2y^2) + 3y^2y' = 1 + y'.$$
From here we can safely move around terms to get the following:
$$2x^2y\cos(x^2y^2)y' + 3y^2y' - y' = 1 - 2xy^2\cos(x^2y^2).$$
Then we can solve for $y'$ to get
$$y' = \frac{1 - 2xy^2\cos(x^2y^2)}{2x^2y\cos(x^2y^2)+3y^2-1}.$$

A graph of this implicit function is given in Figure \ref{fig:2.7.eg3-1}. It is easy to verify that the points $(0,0)$, $(0,1)$ and $(0,-1)$ all lie on the graph. We can find the slopes of the tangent lines at each of these points using our formula for $y'$. 

At $(0,0)$, the slope is $-1$.

At $(0,1)$, the slope is $1/2$.

At $(0,-1)$, the slope is also $1/2$.

The tangent lines have been added to the graph of the function in Figure \ref{fig:2.7.eg3-2}.
