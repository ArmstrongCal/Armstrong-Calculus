\begin{example} \label{Ex:1.1.Eg7}
Let $\ds f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{cc} x & 0\leq x\leq 1 \\ 3-x & 1<x<2\end{array},\right.$ as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:1-1_Eg7}. Find each of the following: 
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item		$\ds \lim_{x\to 1^-} f(x)$
\item		$\ds \lim_{x\to 1^+} f(x)$
\item		$\ds \lim_{x\to 1} f(x)$
\item		$\ds f(1)$
\item		$\ds \lim_{x\to 0^+} f(x)$
\item		$f(0)$
\item		$\ds \lim_{x\to 2^-} f(x)$
\item		$f(2)$
\end{enumerate}
\end{multicols}

\solution For these problems, the visual aid of the graph is likely more effective in evaluating the limits than using $f$ itself. Therefore we will refer often to the graph.
\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item As $x$ goes to $1$ \textit{from the left}, we see that $f(x)$ is approaching the value of $1$. Therefore $\ds \lim_{x\to 1^-} f(x) =1.$

\item As $x$ goes to $1$ \textit{from the right}, we see that $f(x)$ is approaching the value of $2$. Recall that it does not matter that there is an ``open circle'' there; we are evaluating a limit, not the value of the function. Therefore $\ds \lim_{x\to 1^+} f(x)=2$.

\item The limit of $f$ as $x$ approaches $1$ does not exist, as discussed earlier. The function does not approach one particular value, but two different values from the left and the right.

\item Using the definition and by looking at the graph we see that $f(1) = 1$.

\item As $x$ goes to $0$ from the right, we see that $f(x)$ is also approaching $0$. Therefore $\ds \lim_{x\to 0^+} f(x)=0$. Note we cannot consider a left-hand limit at $0$ as $f$ is not defined for values of $x<0$.

\item Using the definition and the graph, $f(0) = 0$.

\item As $x$ goes to $2$ from the left, we see that $f(x)$ is approaching the value of $1$. Therefore $\ds \lim_{x\to 2^-} f(x)=1.$

\item The graph and the definition of the function show that $f(2)$ is not defined.
\end{enumerate}
\end{example}
