\begin{example} \label{Ex:4.6.sub7}
Evaluate $\ds\int_0^2 \cos(3x-1)\ dx$.

\solution
In this example, we begin with
\[ u = 3x - 1 \quad \mbox{and} \quad \frac{du}{dx} = 3 \Rightarrow \frac{1}{3}du = dx. \]
Rewriting the bounds of integration with respect to $u$, we have $u(2) = 3 \cdot 2 - 1 = 5$ and $u(0) = 3 \cdot 0 - 1 = -1$.   We now evaluate the definite integral:
\begin{align*}
\int_1^2 \cos(3x-1) \ dx &=	\int_{-1}^5 \cos(u) \cdot \frac{1}{3} \ du \\
&= \frac{1}{3} \sin(u) \Big|_{-1}^5 \\
&= \frac{1}{3}\big( \sin(5) - \sin(-1) \big)\\
&\approx -0.039.
\end{align*}
Notice how once we converted the integral to be in terms of $u$, we never went back to using $x$.

%The graphs in Figure \ref{fig:subst12} tell more of the story. In (a) the area defined by the original integrand is shaded, whereas in (b) the area defined by the new integrand is shaded. In this particular situation, the areas look very similar; the new region is ``shorter'' but ``wider,'' giving the same area.
