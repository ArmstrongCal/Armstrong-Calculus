  \item  Congratulations, you just won the lottery!  In one option
    presented to you, you will be paid one million dollars a year for
    the next 25 years.  You can deposit this money in an account that
    will earn 5\% each year.

    \ba
  \item Set up a differential equation that describes the rate of
    change in the amount of money in the account.  Two factors cause
    the amount to grow---first, you are depositing one millon dollars
    per year and second, you are earning 5\% interest.

  \item If there is no amount of money in the account when you open
    it, how much money will you have in the account after 25 years?

  \item The second option presented to you is to take a lump sum of 10
    million dollars, which will deposit into a similar account.  How
    much money will you have in that account after 25 years?

  \item At what time does the amount of money in the account under the
    first option overtake the amount of money in the account under the
    second option?

  \item When a skydiver jumps from a plane, gravity causes 
    her downward velocity to increase at the rate of $g\approx 9.8$
    meters per second squared.  At the same time, wind resistance
    causes her velocity to decrease at a rate proportional to the
    velocity.  

    \ba
    \item Using $k$ to represent the constant of proportionality,
      write a differential equation that describes the rate of change
      of the skydiver's velocity.
    \item Find any equilibrium solutions and decide whether they are
        stable or unstable.  Your result should depend on $k$.
      \item Suppose that the initial velocity is zero.  Find the
        velocity $v(t)$.
      \item A typical terminal velocity for a skydiver falling face
        down is 54 meters per second.  What is the value of $k$ for
        this skydiver?
      \item How long does it take to reach 50\% of the terminal
        velocity?

    \item During the first few years of life, the rate at which a baby
      gains rate is proportional to the reciprocal of its weight.

      \ba
      \item Express this fact as a differential equation.

      \item Suppose that a baby weighs 8 pounds at birth and 9 pounds
        one month later.  How much will he weigh at one year?
      \item Do you think this is a realistic model for a long time?

      \item A dose of morphine is 
        absorbed from the bloodstream of a patient at a rate
        proportional to the amount in the bloodstream.  

        \ba
        \item Write a differential equation for $M(t)$, the amount of
          morphine in the patient's bloodstream, using $k$ as the
          constant proportionality.
        \item 
          Assuming that the initial dose of morphine is $M_0$,
          solve the initial value problem to find $M(t)$.  Use the
          fact that the half-life for the absorption of morphine is
          two hours to find the constant $k$.
        \item Suppose that a patient is given morphine intraveneously
          at the rate of 3 milligrams per hour.  Write a differential
          equation that combines the intraveneous administration of
          morphine with the body's natural absorption.
        \item Find any equilibrium solutions and determine their
          stability. 
        \item Assuming that there is initially no morphine in the
          patient's bloodstream, solve the initial value problem to
          determine $M(t)$.
        \item What happens to $M(t)$ after a very long time?
        \item Suppose that a doctor asks you to reduce the
          intraveneous rate so that there is eventually 7 milligrams
          of morphine in the patient's body.  To what rate would you reduce
          the intraveneous flow?
