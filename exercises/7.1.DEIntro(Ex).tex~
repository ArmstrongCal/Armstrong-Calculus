\begin{exercises} 
  \item Suppose that $T(t)$ represents the temperature of a cup of
    coffee set out in a room, where $T$ is expressed in degrees
    Fahrenheit and $t$ in minutes.  A physcial principle, called
    Newton's Law of Cooling, tells us that 
    $$
    \frac{dT}{dt}= -\frac1{15}T+5.
    $$

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item Supposes that $T(0)=105$.  What does the differential equation
      give us for the value of $dT/dt(0)$?  Explain in a complete
      sentence the meaning of these two facts.
      \item Is $T$ increasing or decreasing at $t=0$?
      \item What is the approximate temperature at $t=1$?
      \item On the graph below, make a plot of $dT/dt$ versus $T$.

        \end{center}
      \item For which values of $T$ does $T$ increase?  For which
        values of $T$ does $T$ decrease?
      \item What do you think is the temperature of the room?  Explain
        your thinking.
      \item Verify that $T(t) = 75 + 30e^{-t/15}$ is the solution to the
        differential equation with initial value $T(0) = 105$.
      \end{enumerate}
  
  \item Suppose that the population of a particular species is
    described by the function $P(t)$, where $P$ is expressed in
    millions.  Suppose further that the population's rate of change is
    governed by the differential equation 
    $$\frac{dP}{dt} = f(P)
    $$
    where $f(P)$ is the function graphed below.

    \begin{center}
      \includegraphics{figures/7.1.threshold.eps}
    \end{center}

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item For which values of the population $P$ does the population
      increase?
    \item For which values of the population $P$ does the population
      decrease? 
    \item If $P(0) = 3$, how will the population change in time?
    \item If the initial population satisfies $0<P(0)<1$, what will
      happen to the population after a very long time?
    \item If the initial population satisfies $1<P(0)<3$, what will
      happen to the population after a very long time?
    \item If the initial population satisfies $3<P(0)$, what will
      happen to the population after a very long time?
    \item This model for a population's growth is sometimes called
      ``growth with a threshold.''  Explain why this is an appropriate
      name.  
    \end{enumerate}

  \item 
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Consider the differential equation:
      $$
      \frac{dy}{dt} = y - t.
      $$
      Determine whether the following functions are solutions.

      \medskip
      (i) $y(t) = t + 1 + 2e^t$.

      \medskip
      (ii) $y(t) = t + 1$.

      \medskip
      (iii) $y(t) = t + 2$.

      \medskip

    \item When you weigh bananas in a scale at the grocery store, the
      height $h$ of the bananas is described by the differential
      equation
      $$
      \frac{d^2h}{dt^2} = -kh
      $$
      where $k$ is the {\em spring constant}, a constant that depends
      on the properties of the spring in the scale.  After you put the
      bananas in the scale, you observe that the height of the bananas
      is given by $h(t) = 4\sin(3t)$.  What is the value of the spring
      constant? 
    \end{enumerate}
