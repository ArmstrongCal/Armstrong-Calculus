\subsection*{Introduction}

Recall our definition of a limit of a function from Section~\ref{S:1.1.Limits}.

\definition{The Limit of a Function}{ %DEFINITION 
Given a function $f$, a fixed input $x = a$, and a real number $L$, we say that \emph{$f$ has limit\index{limit!definition} $L$ as $x$ approaches $a$}, and write
\[ \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L \]
provided that we can make $f(x)$ as close to $L$ as we like by taking $x$ sufficiently close (but not equal) to $a$.  If we cannot make $f(x)$ as close to a single value as we would like as $x$ approaches $a$, then we say that \emph{$f$ does not have a limit as $x$ approaches $a$.}
} % end definition

The problem with this definition is that the words "approaches" and "close" are not exact.  In what way does the variable $x$ approach $a$? How "close" do $x$ and $y$ have to be to $a$ and $L$, respectively? Finally, what determines "sufficiently close"? The precise definition we describe in this section comes from formalizing our original definition.  A quick restatement gets us closer to what we want:

\begin{description}
\item ``If $x$ is within a certain \textit{tolerance level} of $a$, then the corresponding value $y=f(x)$ is within a certain \textit{tolerance level} of $L$.''
\end{description}

The accepted notation for the $x$-tolerance is the lowercase Greek letter delta, or $\delta$, and the $y$-tolerance is lowercase epsilon, or $\epsilon$. One more rephrasing nearly gets us to the actual definition:

\begin{description}
\item ``If $x$ is within $\delta$ units of $a$, then the corresponding value of $y$ is within $\epsilon$ units of $L$.''
\end{description}

Note that this means (let the "$\longrightarrow$" represent the word "implies"):
$\ds a - \delta < x < a + \delta \longrightarrow L - \epsilon < y < L + \epsilon$ or  $\ds |x - a| < \delta \longrightarrow  |y - L| < \epsilon$. The point is that $\delta$ and $\epsilon$, being tolerances, can be any positive (but typically small) values.  Finally, we have the formal definition of the limit with the notation  seen in the previous section.

\definition{The Limit of a Function $f$} %DEFINITION 
{Let $f$ be a function defined on an open interval containing $a$. The notation $$\displaystyle \lim_{x\rightarrow a} f(x) = L,$$ read as ``the limit of $f(x)$, as $x$ approaches $a$, is $L$,'' 
means that given any $\epsilon > 0$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that 
whenever $|x - a| < \delta$, we have $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$.\index{limit!definition}
}% end definition

Mathematicians often enjoy writing ideas without using any words. Here is the wordless definition of the limit:
{\small \[ \ds \lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L \iff \forall \ \epsilon > 0, \exists \ \delta > 0 \ \mbox{s.t.} \ |x - a| < \delta \longrightarrow |f(x) - L| < \epsilon. \]}
There is an emphasis here that we may have passed over before.  In the definition, the $y$-tolerance $\epsilon$ is given \textit{first} and then the limit will exist {\em if} we can find an $x$-tolerance $\delta$ that works.  

It is time for an example.  Note that the explanation is long, but it will take you through all steps necessary to understand the ideas.

\input{examples/1-4_Eg1.tex} %EXAMPLE
 
If you are thinking this process is long, you would be right.  The previous example is also a bit unsatisfying in that $\sqrt{4}=2$; why work so hard to prove something so obvious? Many $\epsilon-\delta$ proofs are long and difficult to do. In this section, we will focus on examples where the answer is, frankly, obvious, because the non--obvious examples are even harder.  That is why theorems about limits are so useful! After doing a few more $\epsilon$--$\delta$ proofs, you will really appreciate the analytical "short cuts" we previously discussed. 

\input{examples/1-4_Eg2.tex} %EXAMPLE

\input{examples/1-4_Eg3.tex} %EXAMPLE

We note that we could actually show that $\ds \lim_{x \to a} e^x = e^a$ for any constant $a$.  We do this by factoring out $e^a$ from both sides, leaving us to show $\ds \lim_{x \to a} e^{x-a} = 1$ instead.  By using the substitution $y=x-a$, this reduces to showing $\lim_{y \to 0} e^y = 1 $ which we just did in the last example.  As an added benefit, this shows that in fact the function $f(x)=e^x$ is \textit{continuous} at all values of $x$.

\subsection*{Limits involving infinity}

In the graph of $\ds f(x)= \frac{1}{x^2}$ shown in Figure~\ref{fig:oneoverxsquaredb}, we see that near $0$, the function explodes, getting larger and larger, heading off to positive infinity.

\begin{marginfigure}[1cm]
\margingraphics{figures/figoneoverxsquared} %APEX limits with infinity
\caption{Graph of $f(x) = 1/x^2$. }\label{fig:oneoverxsquaredb}
\end{marginfigure}

Recall from Section~\ref{S:1.2.Infinity} that in a case like this, we write
\[ \lim_{x \to 0} \frac{1}{x^2}=\infty. \]
We can make this notion precise as follows:

\definition{Limit of Infinity, $\infty$} %DEFINITON
{We say $\ds \lim_{x\rightarrow c} f(x)=\infty$ if for every $M>0$ there exists $\delta>0$ such that if $0<|x-c|<\delta$ then $f(x)\geq M$. %\index{limit!of infinity}  
}

This is just like the $\epsilon$--$\delta$ definition of a limit above.  In that definition, given any (small) value $\epsilon$, if we let $x$ get close enough to $c$ (within $\delta$ units of $c$) then $f(x)$ is guaranteed to be within $\epsilon$ of $f(c)$.  Here, given any (large) value $M$, if we let $x$ get close enough to $c$ (within $\delta$ units of $c$), then $f(x)$ will be at least as large as $M$.  In other words, if we get close enough to $c$, then we can make $f(x)$ as large as we want.  We can define limits equal to $-\infty$ in a similar way.

Once again note that by saying $\ds \lim_{x\to c}f(x) = \infty$ we are implicitly stating that \textit{the} limit of $f(x)$, as $x$ approaches $c$, \textit{does not exist.} A limit only exists when $f(x)$ approaches an actual numeric value. We use the concept of limits that approach infinity because they are helpful and descriptive.

\subsection*{Limits at infinity}

Let's again consider $f(x) =\frac{1}{x^2}$, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:oneoverxsquaredb}. Note that as $x$ gets very large, $f(x)$ gets very, very close to zero. We represent this concept with notation such as
\[ \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac1{x^2}=0, \]
and give the following precise definition.

%\begin{marginfigure}[1cm]
%\margingraphics{figures/figoneoverxsquared} %APEX limits with infinity
%\caption{Graph of $f(x) = 1/x^2$. }\label{fig:oneoverxsquared}
%\end{marginfigure}

\definition{Limits at Infinity} %\label{precise.limit.infinity}
{\begin{enumerate}
\item We say $\ds\lim_{x\rightarrow\infty} f(x)=L$ if for every $\epsilon>0$ there exists $N>0$ such that if $x\geq N$, then $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$.\index{limit!at infinity} 

\item We say $\ds\lim_{x\rightarrow-\infty} f(x)=L$ if for every $\epsilon>0$ there exists $N<0$ such that if $x\leq N$, then $|f(x)-L|<\epsilon$.
\end{enumerate}
}

This says that $f$ is sufficiently close to $L$ whenever $x$ is sufficiently large. In other words, if $x$ is greater than some number $N$ then $f(x)$ is between $L-\epsilon$ and $L+\epsilon$. If a smaller $\epsilon$ is chosen, a larger value of $N$ may be required.
