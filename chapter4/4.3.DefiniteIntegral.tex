\subsection*{Introduction}

In this chapter, we have computed or approximated the net signed area that is bounded by a function on a given interval. We now give mathematical notation to signify the net signed area.  

\definition{Net Signed Area as The Definite Integral}% DEFINITION
{Let $y=f(x)$ be defined on a closed interval $[a,b]$. The net signed area from $x=a$ to $x=b$ under $f$ is signified by the {\em definite integral} of $f$ on $[a,b]$, which is denoted 
\[ \int_a^b f(x)\ dx.\]
} % end definition

The area definition of the definite integral allows us to compute the definite integral of some simple functions using geometry as we did in section 4.1.

\end{marginfigure}
  
For instance, if we wish to evaluate the definite integral \\$\ds\int_1^4 (2x+1) \, dx$, we can observe that the region bounded by this function and the $x$-axis is the trapezoid shown in Figure~\ref{fig:4-3_TrapArea}, and by the known formula for the area of a trapezoid, its area is $A = \frac{1}{2}(3+9) \cdot 3 = 18$, so
\[ \int_1^4 (2x+1) \, dx = 18. \]

In section 4.2, we found evidence that if we increase the number of rectangles in a Riemann sum, our accuracy of the approximation of the net signed area. We thus explore the natural idea of allowing the number of rectangles to increase without bound in an effort to compute the exact net signed area bounded by a function on an interval.  In addition, it is important to think about the differences among left, right, and middle Riemann sums and the different results they generate as the value of $n$ increases.  As we have done throughout our investigations with area, we begin with functions that are exclusively positive on the interval under consideration.

\subsection*{The formal definition of the definite integral} \index{definite integral!definition}

In both examples in Preview Activity~\ref{PA:4.3}, we saw that as the number of rectangles got larger and larger, the values of $L_n$, $M_n$, and $R_n$ all grew closer and closer to the same value.  It turns out that this occurs for any continuous function on an interval $[a,b]$, and even more generally for a Riemann sum using any point $x_{i+1}^*$ in the interval $[x_i, x_{i+1}]$.  Said differently, as we let $n \to \infty$, it doesn't really matter where we choose to evaluate the function within a given subinterval, because
\[ \lim_{n \to \infty} L_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} R_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} M_n = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \triangle x.\]
That these limits always exist (and share the same value) for a continuous\footnote{It turns out that a function need not be continuous in order to have a definite integral.  For our purposes, we assume that the functions we consider are continuous on the interval(s) of interest.  It is straightforward to see that any function that is piecewise continuous on an interval of interest will also have a well-defined definite integral.} function $f$ allows us to make the following definition.

\definition{The Definite Integral}{ \label{def:4.3.DefInt} % DEFINITION
The \emph{definite integral} of a continuous function $f$ on the interval $[a,b]$, denoted $\ds \int_a^b f(x) \, dx$, is the real number given by
\[ \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \triangle x,\]
where $\Delta x = \frac{b-a}{n}$, $x_i = a + i\triangle x$ (for $i = 0, \ldots, n$), and $x_i^*$ satisfies $x_{i-1} \le x_i^* \le x_i$ (for $i = 1, \ldots, n$).
} % end definition

We call the symbol $\int$ the \emph{integral sign}\index{integral sign}, the values $a$ and $b$ the \emph{limits or bounds of integration}\index{limits of integration}\index{bounds of integration}, and the function $f$ the \emph{integrand}\index{integrand}.  The process of determining the real number $\int_a^b f(x) \, dx$ is called \emph{evaluating the definite integral}.  While we will come to understand that there are several different interpretations of the value of the definite integral, for now the most important is that $\int_a^b f(x) \, dx$ measures the net signed area bounded by $y = f(x)$ and the $x$-axis on the interval $[a,b]$.  

\begin{marginfigure} % MARGIN FIGURE
\margingraphics{figs/4/4-2_NegFc.pdf}
\caption{A continuous function $f$ on the interval $[a,d]$.} \label{fig:4-3_NegFc}
\end{marginfigure}

For example, in the notation of the definite integral, if $f$ is the function pictured in Figure~\ref{fig:4-3_NegFc} and $A_1$, $A_2$, and $A_3$ are the exact areas bounded by $f$ and the $x$-axis on the respective intervals $[a,b]$, $[b,c]$, and $[c,d]$, then
\[ \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = A_1, \ \int_b^c f(x) \, dx = -A_2, \ \int_c^d f(x) \, dx = A_3, \]
and
\[ \int_a^d f(x) \, dx = A_1 - A_2 + A_3. \]
We can also use definite integrals to express the change in position and distance traveled by a moving object.  In the setting of a velocity function $v$ on an interval $[a,b]$, it follows from our work above and in preceding sections that the change in position, $s(b) - s(a)$, is given by
\[ s(b) - s(a) = \int_a^b v(t) \, dt. \]
If the velocity function is nonnegative on $[a,b]$, then $\int_a^b v(t) \,dt$ tells us the distance the object traveled.  When velocity is sometimes negative on $[a,b],$ the areas bounded by the function on intervals where $v$ does not change sign can be found using integrals, and the sum of these values will tell us the distance the object traveled. 

If we wish to compute the value of a definite integral using the definition, we have to take the limit of a sum.  While this is possible to do in select circumstances, it is also tedious and time-consuming; therefore, we typically take the limit of only relatively simple sums.

In Section~\ref{S:4.4.FTC}, we will learn the Second Part of the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, a theorem that provides an analytical process for evaluating a large class of definite integrals.  This will enable us to determine the exact net signed area bounded by a continuous function and the $x$-axis in many circumstances, including examples such as $\ds\int_1^4 (x^2 + 1) \, dx$, which we approximated by Riemann sums in Preview Activity~\ref{PA:4.3}.

For now, our goal is to understand the meaning and properties of the definite integral, rather than how to actually compute its value using ideas in calculus.  Thus, we temporarily rely on the net signed area interpretation of the definite integral and observe that if a given curve produces regions whose areas we can compute exactly through known area formulas, we can thus compute the exact value of the integral.

% SUBSECTION SOME PROPERTIES OF THE DEFINITE INTEGRAL
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsection*{Some properties of the definite integral}

With the perspective that the definite integral of a function $f$ over an interval $[a,b]$ measures the net signed area bounded by $f$ and the $x$-axis over the interval, we naturally arrive at several different standard properties of the definite integral.  In addition, it is helpful to remember that the definite integral is defined in terms of Riemann sums that fundamentally consist of the areas of rectangles.

\concept{Properties of the Definite Integral} % CONCEPT
{Let $f$ and $g$ be defined on a closed interval $I$ that contains the values $a$, $b$ and $c$, and let $k$ be a constant. The following hold:\index{integration!definite!properties}\index{definite integral!properties}
\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item $\ds \int_a^a f(x) \ dx = 0$

\item $\ds \int_a^b f(x) \ dx + \int_b^c f(x)\ dx = \int_a^cf(x)\ dx$

\item $\ds \int_b^a f(x) \ dx = -\int_a^b f(x)\ dx$

\item $\ds \int_a^b k \cdot f(x) \ dx = k \cdot \int_a^b f(x) \ dx$

\item $\ds \int_a^b \big( f(x)\pm g(x) \big) \ dx = \int_a^b f(x) \ dx \pm \int_a^b g(x) \ dx$
\end{enumerate}
} % end concept

We give a brief justification the properties here.
\begin{enumerate}[1)]
\item If we consider the definite integral $\int_a^a f(x) \, dx$ for any real number $a$, it is evident that no area is being bounded because the interval begins and ends with the same point.  Hence, this definite integral is $0$.
   
\begin{marginfigure} % MARGIN FIGURE
\margingraphics{figs/4/4-3_AddProp.pdf}
\caption{A continuous function $f$ on the interval $[a,d]$.} \label{fig:4-3_AddProp}
\end{marginfigure}
		
\item This states that total area is the sum of the areas of subregions. In Figure~\ref{fig:4-3_AddProp}, we see that  \small
$$\int_a^b f(x) \, dx = A_1, \ \int_b^c f(x) \, dx = A_2, \ \mbox{and} \ \int_a^c f(x) \, dx = A_1 + A_2.$$ \normalsize
It is important to note that this still holds true even if $a<b<c$ is not true. 

\item This result makes sense because if we integrate from $a$ to $b$, then in the defining Riemann sum $\triangle x = \frac{b-a}{n}$, while if we integrate from $b$ to $a$, $\triangle x = \frac{a-b}{n} = -\frac{b-a}{n}$, and this is the only change in the sum used to define the integral.

\item First, let's consider the situation pictured in Figure~\ref{fig:4-3_ConstMultb}, where we examine the effect of multiplying a function  in Figure~\ref{fig:4-3_ConstMulta} by a factor of $2$ on the area it bounds with the $x$-axis.  Because multiplying the function by $2$ doubles its height at every $x$-value, we see that if we consider a typical rectangle from a Riemann sum, the difference in area comes from the changed height of the rectangle:  $f(x_i)$ for the original function, versus $2f(x_i)$ in the doubled function, in the case of left sum.  Hence, we see that for the pictured rectangles with areas $A$ and $B$, it follows $B = 2A$.  As this will happen in every such rectangle, regardless of the value of $n$ and the type of sum we use, we see that in the limit, the area of the red region bounded by $y = 2f(x)$ will be twice that of the area of the blue region bounded by $y = f(x)$.  As there is nothing special about the value $2$ compared to an arbitrary constant $k$, it turns out that the general principle holds.

\begin{marginfigure}[-9cm] % MARGIN FIGURE

\includegraphics[scale=.5]{figs/4/4-3_ConstMulta.pdf}

\caption{The area bounded by $y = 2f(x)$ on $[a,b]$.} \label{fig:4-3_ConstMultb}
\end{center}
\end{marginfigure}

\item Finally, we see a similar situation geometrically with the sum of two functions $f$ and $g$. In particular, as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:4-3_Sum}, if we take the sum of two functions $f$ and $g$, at every point in the interval, the height of the function $f+g$ is given by $(f+g)(x_i) = f(x_i) + g(x_i)$, which is the sum of the individual function values of $f$ and $g$ (taken at left endpoints).  Hence, for the pictured rectangles with areas $A$, $B$, and $C$, it follows that $C = A + B$, and because this will occur for every such rectangle, in the limit the area of the gray region will be the sum of the areas of the blue and red regions.

% SUMMARY
%-------------
\begin{summary}
\item Any Riemann sum of a continuous function $f$ on an interval $[a,b]$ provides an estimate of the net signed area bounded by the function and the horizontal axis on the interval.  Increasing the number of subintervals in the Riemann sum improves the accuracy of this estimate, and letting the number of subintervals increase without bound results in the values of the corresponding Riemann sums approaching the exact value of the enclosed net signed area.

\item When we take the just described limit of Riemann sums, we arrive at what we call the definite integral of $f$ over the interval $[a,b]$.  In particular, the symbol $\int_a^b f(x) \, dx$ denotes the definite integral of $f$ over $[a,b]$, and this quantity is defined by the equation
\[ \int_a^b f(x) \, dx = \lim_{n \to \infty} \sum_{i=1}^{n} f(x_i^*) \triangle x, \]
where $\triangle x = \frac{b-a}{n}$, $x_i = a + i\triangle x$ (for $i = 0, \ldots, n$), and $x_i^*$ satisfies $x_{i-1} \le x_i^* \le x_i$ (for $i = 1, \ldots, n$).

\item The definite integral $\int_a^b f(x) \,dx$ measures the exact net signed area bounded by $f$ and the horizontal axis on $[a,b]$. %; in addition, the value of the definite integral is related to what we call the average value of the function on $[a,b]$: $f_{\mbox{\tiny{AVG}}[a,b]} = \frac{1}{b-a} \cdot \int_a^b f(x) \, dx.$  
In the setting where we consider the integral of a velocity function $v$, $\int_a^b v(t) \,dt$ measures the exact change in position of the moving object on $[a,b]$; when $v$ is nonnegative, $\int_a^b v(t) \,dt$ is the object's distance traveled on $[a,b]$.  

\item The definite integral is a sophisticated sum, and thus has some of the same natural properties that finite sums have.  Perhaps most important of these is how the definite integral respects sums and constant multiples of functions, which can be summarized by the rule
\[ \ds \int_a^b [c f(x) \pm k g(x)] \,dx = c \int_a^b f(x) \,dx \pm k \int_a^b g(x) \,dx \]
where $f$ and $g$ are continuous functions on $[a,b]$ and $c$ and $k$ are arbitrary constants.
