\begin{activity} \label{A:1.1.1}  Consider the function $f(x) = \dfrac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}$.
\ba
\item Does the value of $f(1)$ exist? Why/why not?

\item Use a calculator or spreadsheet to fill in the blanks of Table~\ref{T:1-1_Act1}. Some of these have already been done for you; your calculations should not be drastically different from the ones already here. For example a calculation equal to 22.5 is very likely incorrect. Based on the table, estimate the value of $\ds \lim_{x \to 1} \frac{x^2 - 1}{x-1}$. 

\item Plot an accurate graph of the function $f$.  It should be a straight line.  Using your plot, what is $f(1)$?  What is $\ds \lim_{x \to 1} f(x)$?

\item Now use algebra to simplify the fraction $\dfrac{x^2 - 1}{x - 1}$. Call this new function $g(x)$.  What is $\ds \lim_{x \to 1} g(x)$? How is this limit related to the limit of $f(x)$ as $x$ approaches $1$?
