\begin{activity} \label{A:6.6.1}  Suppose that for a certain population in a given country, the age density function $p(x)$ is given by the function $$p(x) = 0.002911 \left( \frac{1}{2048}x^4-\frac{1}{64}x^2+10 \right)e^{-0.1313x}, \ 0 \le x \le 100.$$
The units on $p$ are ``fraction of the population per year of age'' where $x$ measures the age of a person in years.  A graph of $p$ is shown in Figure~\ref{F:}
\ba
	\item What fraction of the population is between the ages of 10 and 12?  Write a definite integral and use computational technology to evaluate it.
	  \item Make two observations about trends in the population based on the graph of this density function.
	  \item Use computational technology to evaluate the integral expression
	  $$\frac{\int_0^{105} xp(x) \, dx}{\int_0^{105} p(x) \, dx}.$$
	  What is the meaning of the value you found?
	  \item Use computational technology to estimate the value of $M$ for which $\int_0^M p(x) \, dx = \frac{1}{2}$.  What is the meaning of the value $M$ in the context of the problem?
