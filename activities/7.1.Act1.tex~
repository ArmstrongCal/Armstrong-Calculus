          The temperature of the hot chocolate cools by 10\% of
          the difference between the hot chocolate's temperature and
          the room temperature every minute.
        \item A can of cold soda is sitting in a 70$^\circ$ room.
          The temperature of the soda warms at the rate of 10\% of
          the difference between the soda's temperature and
          the room's temperature every minute.
