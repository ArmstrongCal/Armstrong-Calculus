\begin{activity} \label{A:7.6.2}  
  Consider the logistic equation
  $$
  \frac{dP}{dt} = kP(N-P)
  $$
  with the graph of $\frac{dP}{dt}$ vs.~$P$ shown below.

\item At what value of $P$ is the rate of change greatest?

\item Consider the model for the earth's population that we created.
  At what value of $P$ is the rate of change greatest?  How does that
  compare to the population in recent years?

\item According to the model we developed, what will the population be
  in the year 2100?

\item According to the model we developed, when will the population
  reach 9 billion?

\item Now consider the general solution to the general logistic initial value problem that
  we found, given by
  $$
  P(t) = \frac{N}{\left(\frac{N-P_0}{P_0}\right)e^{-kNt} + 1}.
  $$
  Verify algebraically that $P(0) = P_0$ and that $\lim_{t\to\infty} P(t) = N$.
