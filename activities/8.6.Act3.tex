\begin{activity} \label{8.6.Act3} Let $f$ be the function given by the power series expansion
\[f(x) = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} (-1)^k \frac{x^{2k}}{(2k)!}.\]
\ba
\item Assume that we can differentiate a power series term by term, just like we can differentiate a (finite) polynomial. Use the fact that
\[f(x) = 1 - \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^4}{4!} - \frac{x^6}{6!} + \cdots + (-1)^k \frac{x^{2k}}{(2k)!} + \cdots \]
to find a power series expansion for $f'(x)$.

\item Observe that $f(x)$ and $f'(x)$ have familiar Taylor series.  What familiar functions are these? What known relationship does our work demonstrate?

\item What is the series expansion for $f''(x)$?  What familiar function is $f''(x)$?

\item Note that
\[f'(x) = - 2x + \frac{x^3}{3!} - \frac{x^5}{5!} + \cdots + (-1)^k \frac{x^{k-1}}{(k-1)!} + \cdots .\]
\item We recognize $f(x)$ as $\cos(x)$ and $f'(x)$ as $-\sin(x)$. this gives the known differentiation formula
\[\frac{d}{dx} \cos(x) = -\sin(x).\]
