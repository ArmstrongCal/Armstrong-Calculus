  Let's consider the differential equation 
$$
\frac{dy}{dt} = -\frac 12 y(y-4).
$$

\ba
\item Make a plot of $\frac{dy}{dt}$ versus $y$.  Looking at the
  graph, for what values of $y$ does $y$ increase and for what values
  does it decrease?

\item Identify any equilibrium solutions of this differential equation.

\item Now sketch the slope field for this differential equation.

  \end{center}

\item  Sketch the solutions with an initial value in the range $-1\leq
  y(0)\leq 5$.   

\item  An equilibrium solution $\overline{y}$ is called {\em stable}
  if nearby 
  solutions converge to $\overline{y}$.  This means that if the inital
  condition varies slightly from $\overline{y}$, then
  $\lim_{t\to\infty}y(t) = \overline{y}$.  

  Conversely, an equilibrium solution $\overline{y}$ 
  is called {\em unstable} if nearby solutions are pushed away from
  $\overline{y}$.

  Using your work above, classify the equilibrium solutions you found
  as either stable or unstable.

\item Suppose that $y(t)$ describes the population of a species of
  living organisms and that the initial value $y(0)>0$.  What can you
  say about the eventual fate of this population?  

\item  Remember that an equilibrium solution $\overline{y}$ satisfies
  $f(\overline{y}) = 0$.  If we graph $dy/dt = f(y)$ as a function of
  $y$, for which of the following differential equations is
  $\overline{y}$ a stable equilibrium and for which is it unstable?
