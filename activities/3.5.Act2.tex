\begin{activity} \label{A:3.5.2}  In this activity, we will discuss two important consequences of the Mean Value Theorem.  
\ba
 \item Suppose $f'(x)=0$ for $x$ in $[a,b]$. What can we say about $f(x)$ on the interval $[a,b]$?
 \item Given two functions $f$ and $g$ defined on $[a,b]$ such that $f'(x)=g'(x)$ for all $x$ in $[a,b]$, what can we say about the functions themselves? How are $f$ and $g$ related?
