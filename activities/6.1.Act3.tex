\begin{activity} \label{A:6.1.3}  In each of the following questions, draw a careful, labeled sketch of the region described, as well as the solid that results from revolving the region about the stated axis.  In addition, draw a representative slice and state the volume of that slice, along with a definite integral whose value is the volume of the entire solid.  For each prompt, use the finite region $S$ in the first quadrant bounded by the curves $y = 2x$ and $y = x^3$.
\ba
	\item Revolve $S$ about the line $y = -2$.	
	\item Revolve $S$ about the line $y = 4$.
	\item Revolve $S$ about the line $x=-1$.	
	\item Revolve $S$ about the line $x = 5$.
