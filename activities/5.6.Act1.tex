\begin{activity} \label{A:5.6.1}  In this activity, we explore the relationships among the errors generated by left, right, midpoint, and trapezoid approximations to the definite integral $\int_1^2 \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx$. 
\ba
	\item Use the First FTC to evaluate $\int_1^2 \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx$ exactly.
	\item Use appropriate computing technology to compute the following approximations for $\int_1^2 \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx$:  $T_4$, $M_4$, $T_8$, and $M_8$.  
	\item Let the \emph{error} \index{error} \index{trapezoid rule!error} \index{midpoint rule!error} of an approximation be the difference between the exact value of the definite integral and the resulting approximation.  For instance, if we let $E_{T,4}$ represent the error that results from using the trapezoid rule with $4$ subintervals to estimate the integral, we have 
	$$E_{T,4} = \int_1^2 \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx -  T_4.$$
	Similarly, we compute the error of the midpoint rule approximation with 8 subintervals by the formula
	$$E_{M,8} = \int_1^2 \frac{1}{x^2} \, dx -  M_8.$$
	Based on your work in (a) and (b) above, compute $E_{T,4}$, $E_{T,8}$, $E_{M,4}$, $E_{M,8}$.
	\item Which rule consistently over-estimates the exact value of the definite integral?  Which rule consistently under-estimates the definite integral?
	\item What behavior(s) of the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$ lead to your observations in (d)?
