Let $f(x) = x^n$, where $n$ is a positive integer.  The goal of this problem is to prove the Power Rule for derivatives, that we used in earlier work in this section.
\ba
\item State the Binomial Theorem.

\item Using the Binomial Theorem, expand $(x + h)^n$ for some positive integer $n$.

\item Use the limit definition of the derivative along with the Binomial Theorem to show that
\[ f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{x^n+nx^{n-1}h + \frac{n(n-1)}{2}x^{n-2}h^2 \cdots h^n - x^n}{h}. \]

\item Simplify the numerator of the derivative so that each term is multiplied by some expression in terms of $h$.

\item Reduce and compute the limit using algebra.
