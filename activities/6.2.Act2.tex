\begin{activity} \label{A:6.2.2}  
In each of the following questions, draw a careful, labeled sketch of the region described, as well as the resulting solid that results from revolving the region about the stated axis.  In addition, draw a representative slice and state the volume of that slice, along with a definite integral whose value is the volume of the entire solid.  It is not necessary to evaluate the integrals you find.

	\item The region $S$ bounded by the $y$-axis, the curve $y = \sqrt{x}$, and the line $y = 2$; revolve $S$ about the $y$-axis.
	\item The region $S$ bounded by the $x$-axis, the curve $y = \sqrt{x}$, and the line $x = 4$; revolve $S$ about the $y$-axis.
	\item The finite region $S$ in the first quadrant bounded by the curves $y = 2x$ and $y = x^3$; revolve $S$ about the $x$-axis.	
	\item The finite region $S$ in the first quadrant bounded by the curves $y = 2x$ and $y = x^3$; revolve $S$ about the $y$-axis.
	\item The finite region $S$ bounded by the curves $x = (y-1)^2$ and $y  = x-1$; revolve $S$ about the $y$-axis
