\begin{activity} \label{A:7.4.1}  
Suppose that the population of a town is increases by 3\% every year.

\ba
\item Let $P(t)$ be the population of the town in year $t$.  Write a
  differential equation that describes the annual growth rate.

\item Find the solutions of this differential equation.

\item If you know that the town's population in year 0 is 10,000, find
  the population $P(t)$.

\item How long does it take for the population to double?  This time
  is called the {\em doubling time}.

\item Working more generally, find the doubling time if the annual
  growth rate is $k$ times the population.
