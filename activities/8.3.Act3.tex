\begin{activity} \label{8.3.Act3} Determine if the Divergence Test applies to the following series. If the test does not apply, explain why. If the test does apply, what does it tell us about the series?

\ba
\item  $\sum \frac{k}{k+1}$
\item  $\sum (-1)^k $

\item  $\sum \frac{1}{k}$

\begin{activitySolution}
\ba
	\item Since the sequence $\frac{k}{k+1}$ converges to 1 and not 0 as $k$ goes to infinity, the Divergence Test applies here and shows that the series $\sum \frac{k}{k+1}$ diverges.
    \item Since $\ds \lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{1}{k} = 0$, the Divergence Test does not apply to this series.
