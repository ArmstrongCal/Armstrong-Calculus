\begin{activity} \label{A:2.8.1}  
For each function given below, find its derivative.
\ba
	   \item $h(x) = x^2\ln(x)$
	   \item  $p(t) = \ds \frac{\ln(t)}{e^t + 1}$
           \item $s(y) = \ln(\cos(y) + 2)$
           \item $z(x) = \tan(\ln(x))$
           \item $m(z) = \ln(\ln(z))$
\ea
\end{activity}
\begin{smallhint}
\ba
	   \item Is $h$ a product, quotient, or composition of basic functions?
	   \item Is $p$ a product, quotient, or composition of basic functions?
	   \item Is $s$ a product, quotient, or composition of basic functions?
	   \item Is $z$ a product, quotient, or composition of basic functions?
	   \item Is $m$ a product, quotient, or composition of basic functions?
\ea
\end{smallhint}
\begin{bighint}
\ba
	   \item Try using the product rule.
	   \item Note that $p$ is a quotient of basic functions.
	   \item Observe that $s$ is a composite function with $f(y) = \ln(y)$ as the outer function.
	   \item What is the outer function in this composite function?  The inner function?
	   \item The natural log function is being composed with itself.  What are the inner and outer functions?
\ea
\end{bighint}
\begin{activitySolution}
\ba
	   \item By the product rule, 
	   $$h'(x) = x^2\cdot \frac{1}{x} + \ln(x) \cdot 2x = x + 2x\ln(x).$$
	   \item By the quotient rule, 
	   $$p'(t) = \frac{(e^t + 1) \frac{1}{t} - \ln(t) \cdot e^t}{(e^t + 1)^2}.$$
           \item The chain rule tells us that
           $$s'(y) = \frac{1}{\cos(y) + 2)} \cdot (-\sin(y)).$$
           \item Again using the chain rule,
           $$z'(x) = \sec^2(\ln(x)) \cdot \frac{1}{x}.$$
           \item Noting that $m$ is composite with the natural logarithm function serving as both the inner and outer function, we find that
           $$m'(z) = \frac{1}{\ln(z)} \cdot \frac{1}{z}.$$
