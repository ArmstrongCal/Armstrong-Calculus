\begin{activity} \label{A:6.1.2}  In each of the following problems, our goal is to determine the area of the region described.  For each region, (i) determine the intersection points of the curves, (ii) sketch the region whose area is being found, (iii) draw and label a representative slice, and (iv) state the area of the representative slice.  Then, state a definite integral whose value is the exact area of the region, and evaluate the integral to find the numeric value of the region's area.  {\bf Note well:} At the step where you draw a representative slice, you need to make a choice about whether to slice vertically or horizontally.

	\item The finite region bounded by $x=y^2$ and $x=6-2y^2$.
	\item The finite region bounded by $x=1-y^2$ and $x = 2-2y^2$.
	\item The area bounded by the $x$-axis, $y=x^2$, and $y=2-x$.
	\item The finite regions between the curves $x=y^2-2y$ and $y=x$.
