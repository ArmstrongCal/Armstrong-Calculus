\begin{activity} \label{A:2.5.1}  
For each function given below, identify an inner function $g$ and outer function $f$ to write the function in the form $f(g(x))$.  Then, determine $f'(x)$, $g'(x)$, and $f'(g(x))$, and finally apply the chain rule to determine the derivative of the given function. Also, use the Leibniz notation of the chain rule for each function.

	   \item The outer function is $f(x) = \cos(x)$, while the inner function is $g(x) = x^4$, and we know that 
	   $$f'(x) = -\sin(x), g'(x) = 4x^3, \ \mbox{and} \ f'(g(x)) = -\sin(x^4).$$
	   Hence, by the chain rule,
	   $$h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) = -4x^3\sin(x^4).$$
	   \item The outer function is $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$, while the inner function is $g(x) = \tan(x)$, and we know that 
	   $$f'(x) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}, g'(x) = \sec^2(x), \ \mbox{and} \ f'(g(x)) = \frac{1}{2\sqrt{\tan(x)}}.$$
	   Hence, by the chain rule,
	   $$h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) = \frac{\sec^2(x)}{2\sqrt{\tan(x)}}.$$
           \item The outer function is $f(x) = 2^x$, while the inner function is $g(x) = \sin(x)$, and we know that 
	   $$f'(x) = 2^x \ln(2), g'(x) = \cos(x), \ \mbox{and} \ f'(g(x)) = 2^{\sin(x)}\ln(2).$$
	   Hence, by the chain rule,
	   $$h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) = 2^{\sin(x)}\ln(2)\cos(x).$$
           \item The outer function is $f(x) = x^5$, while the inner function is $g(x) = \cot(x)$, and we know that 
	   $$f'(x) = 5x^4, g'(x) = -\csc^2(x), \ \mbox{and} \ f'(g(x)) = 5\cot^4(x).$$
	   Hence, by the chain rule,
	   $$h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) = -5\cot^4(x) \csc^2(x).$$
           \item The outer function is $f(x) = x^9$, while the inner function is $g(x) = \sec(x) + e^x$, and we know that 
	   $$f'(x) = 9x^8, g'(x) = \sec(x)\tan(x) + e^x, \ \mbox{and} \ f'(g(x)) = 9(\sec(x)+e^x)^8.$$
	   Hence, by the chain rule,
	   $$h'(x) = f'(g(x))g'(x) = 9(\sec(x)+e^x)^8 (\sec(x)\tan(x) + e^x).$$
