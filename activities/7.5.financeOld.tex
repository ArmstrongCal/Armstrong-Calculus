  Suppose you have a bank account that grows by 5\% every year.

\ba
\item Let $A(t)$ be the amount of money in the account in year $t$.
  What is the rate of change of $A$?

\item Suppose that you are also withdrawing \$10,000 per year.  Write
  a differential equation that expresses the total rate of change of
  $A$. 

\item Sketch a slope field for this differential equation, find any
  equilibrium solutions, and identify them as either stable or
  unstable.  Write a sentence or two that describes the significance
  of the stability of the equilibrium solution.

\item Suppose that you initially deposit \$100,000 into the account.  How
  long does it take for you to deplete the account?

\item What is the smallest amount of money you would need to have in
  the account to guarantee that you never deplete the money in the
  account? 
\item If your initial deposit is \$300,000, how much could you
  withdraw every year without depleting the account?
